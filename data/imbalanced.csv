They do an amazing job cleaning my car. I always get a full shampoo and upholstery cleaning from them and the car always looks brand new!,1,1
"Every staff member that helped me (both inside and outside of the place) was incredible nice and helpful and my car came out looking wonderful. I was unfortunately cut in line at the register by a self-important jerk of a customer who proceeded to berate the cashier for not giving him a deal. The poor register girl did a wonderful job of dealing with this jerk and then was able to switch gears and return to business when I got my turn to pay. So, even more kudos to the business and its employees for not letting mean people affect their customer service.",1,1
"Alex, Joshua and the whole staff in the eyewear department are awesome. They are friendly, knowledgeable and got me a super deal on my glasses I would recommend this Walmart to my family and friends.",1,1
"One of my favorite Wal Marts.  Clean, orderly but holy cow they draw some freaky people shopping here.  I've had some memorable experiences dealing with the crazy folks who shop here.  Guess that is why I keep coming back, you never know what kind of experience you'll have.",1,1
This 5 star review is for the Auto Department. We walked in to kill time and decided to get an oil change because our car was due.  I appreciate how the employees gave us an honest estimated wait time.  The oil change was done within the estimated time given and the check out was fast and easy.  Employees friendly!,1,1
"This is all about Elina (I hope I got your name right) at the self service checkouts. She saw that all I had were two large, awkward items and she checked me out herself so I wouldn't have to lift them for scanning. Honestly, I don't come to Walmart for customer service, and I was having a rotten day; so thank you for the pleasant surprise and helping to turn my day around.",1,1
"One of the best Wal-Marts I've been to. It is clean , neat, and well organized. But, no one has ever come up to ask me if I needed help finding anything. Other than that I have no complaints.",1,1
"I drove my friends mom to this pharmacy on 6/22/16 to pick up her medication. When she got there the pharmacy was extremely busy. Something happened with her personal insurance being switched to Medicare which caused her old insurance to cancel making her prescriptions prices hundreds of dollars. She was in shock because the price was so high and she couldn't afford it. A pharmacy technician named Antonio who was extremely busy with a long line of people waiting for their medicine, went out of his way to help my friends mom get her insurance back to her original insurance coverage. He is a very educated pharmacy technician and I hope he becomes a Pharmacist because he would be a great one. Antonio walked us through the process while he was super busy to get the situation figured out. I'm in sales and take pride in excellent customer service because that's what it's all about. Antonio went above and beyond for us and helped us for two hours as my friends mom was on the phone trying to figure everything out. He guided my friends mom and helped get her insurance problem fixed. I just want to say thank you to Antonio in the pharmacy and give that man a raise. He impressed me with his calmness and his patience for people who are clueless on how their insurance actually works. Antonio may you be successful in all your endeavors and thank you for excellent customer care. Cheers my friend!!!",1,1
"Mickies!   To be honest, I haven't been here in ages. I use to come here all the time when I was a student and absolutely loved it. When I was in Madison, this was the shinning beacon of breakfast joints.   During the weekends it would get pretty crowded. So crowded that sometimes the people waiting for tables could hover you. At times, that was a bit uncomfie. Otherwise, everything else was fabulous.   Its retro in looks and amazing in taste. Love the scramblers. I also have fond memories of their pancakes as I got to have them next to Butch Vig.",1,1
"It was Sunday morning (ish) after a long weekend of exploring (drinking) around Madison. The room was full of worn-out (hungover) people, and we were all looking for something to cure us of our ailments before a long drive back to Indy. Mickies was suggested immediately by everyone in the room who knew the area, and we set off for what had been described to me as a must-visit when you are anywhere near Camp Randall.   The first thing you will likely notice when you approach this establishment is the line of people outside waiting for a table. If you aren't someone who can wait for your food, you better get here early. That being said, unless you are seconds away from keeling over due to excessive hunger you are best off just to wait. The tables get turned over quickly so the wait likely isn't as long as you might first suspect.   Once you finally do make it in, you quickly get an idea of what this place is all about. It's not big, but they utilize every ounce of space they have. It looks like your stereotypical greasy spoon diner, with a big bar in the middle surrounded by a bunch of booths and tables that are all a little bit closer that put you a little closer to your neighbor than you would like. The hostess was surprisingly nice and organized for how busy it was that morning, and it appeared this was just business as usual. We were seated in a booth and directed to the large menu up on the wall.   As far as the food goes, this place is the definition of ""you get what you pay for."" It's what they try to do and you can't possibly fault them for not doing it well. It's a lot of your standard breakfast items at prices that can't be beat. They are served greasy spoon style, so your sweet foods are going to slightly resemble a breakfast item that has been turned into an over the top dessert, your savory foods might actually stop your heart after the first few bites, and everything in between is going to come with enough food to feed a small family. You can easily walk in here with $5 and walk out full. Being a weekend of gluttony already, I opted for what they called the ""scrambler"" which was somewhere around $7 and came with a little bit of everything. Basically, it was a bunch of hash browns, covered with a bunch of eggs, stuffed with a bunch of meats, topped with a bunch of cheese, and covered with a bunch of gravy. They serve that with a health portion of toast and call it a meal. It was the perfect meal for me that morning, and I even struggled to finish half of it.   This place is what it is. It's a college place in the shadow of one of the best places to watch a football game anywhere in the country. You aren't going to get any culinary masterpieces or unique creations. The flavors don't taste better than anywhere else, and the guy cooking isn't trying to make any fusion dishes to mess with your taste buds. You will, however, get a ton of food for a small amount of money that will hit the spot when you are looking for some comfort food or a sugar rush. If that sounds like something you enjoy, this place needs to be on top of your list.  P.S. Cash only",1,1
"Great deal. Great service. NEVER go on a homegame day. EVER. No one ever listens to me but I swear that the cornmeal pancakes are some of the best I've ever had. As my boyfriend says, this place serves food that ""sticks to your ribs.""",1,1
"Best greasy spoon in downtown Madison.  As many people have noticed, portions are huge and they only take cash and they can be quite busy.  COnsidering how busy they are, I think service is decently fast.  I like the chili cheese omelettes and the pancakes.  The malts are good but I never order them because I can't imagine how bad my stomach would feel after a scrambler AND a malt!",1,1
"I finally decided to visit this local favorite, and I was lucky enough to be seated right away. During warmer months, expect a long line out the door though!  The place is cash only, but they have an ATM machine. Their menu is simple to navigate, but they have a lot of choices. Some notable items are their french toast (which is made out of cinnamon rolls instead of white bread), scramblers (gigantic mixtures of scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, fried potatoes, cheese, and gravy if you want it), and the cornmeal pancake (think corn bread cooked like a pancake).  I got the chili cheese omelette with ""yanks"" which are their fried potatoes. For $7.50, I got a probably 3 potatoes worth of yanks, and an omelette topped with chili, shredded cheddar, and american cheese sauce with 2 slices of toast. It was a lot of food. I saw a lot of people taking leftover omelettes and scramblers in take out boxes, so I was proud of myself for being able to finish the whole thing.  I should probably talk about the service: It was friendly, fast, and helpful. They were quick to help me decide on what to order, and they were able to explain all their menu items and point out their unique dishes.  Overall, I had a great experience. The food was good and cheap and the atmosphere was loud but homey. While I had a great time, I just can't give Mickies an honest 5 stars because I can't confidently say that this is one of the best diners I've been to food-wise. The food was interesting and pretty good, but I didn't find it to be as refined as some other diners I've been to in the past few years. For example, the french toast made of cinnamon rolls was pretty good, but I found it to be too eggy and dense and not fluffy at all. It was like eating scrambled eggs with cinnamon rolls inside. Still, Mickies is a great place to eat breakfast. If you live in Madison, this should be on your bucket list.",1,1
This place is always filled with people. Go early to avoid having to wait in long line especially on game days. I really recommend their pancakes and milkshakes. The other dishes are very cheese based for example their scrambler are basically eggs and tons of cheese. The food portion here is huge and the price is quite cheap. Service is pretty fast and friendly,1,1
Very old fashioned restaurant and so cute! Very cheap food but very busy atmosphere for Saturday at noon. I got the chocolate chip pancakes which were unlike any pancakes I've had before. I personally didn't like them because they were almost like cake batter. The chocolate malt is definitely the best malt I've had and very filling!y boyfriend got a ham and sausage scrambler and that was so good! The gravy is very good with the potatoes. Definitely will be back to try out more stuff!!!,1,1
"YUM!  This busy little place has an actual bar.   I grabbed a stool at the bar on a Saturday morning and ordered the Scrambler with sausage. YUM!  It's the perfect combination of creamy egg, melting cheese, perfectly cooked potatoes, and yummy sausage.  The place is huge and comes with four half slices of wheat toast.  Best $7 spent.  The Blueberry Coffee Cake was also good at only $2.  The coffee is mediocre at $1.50.",1,1
Such a cute little diner! The menu was on the wall which was really fun. Service was quick and friendly. We would come again.,1,1
We were in WIsconsin for a wedding last week and only had one day to spend in Madison. Our very first stop? Mickie's! It's always packed in the mornings with hung over college kids and hot as all get out during the summer. The service is pretty slow and it's usually so noisy you can barely hear yourself think but it's awesome! We had to go in and get a sausage scrambler. The size of the thing is massive and seeing it  helped me understand why I put on so much weight in college :)   This place is just a Madison landmark and I look forward to many more scramblers in visits to come.,1,1
Mickies is the best breakfast joint in Madison.   Been going Mickie's for 20 years and have never been disappointed with the experience.   Favorite dish is the bacon scrambler.,1,1
The scrambler is delicious and it's only 7 dollar (big portion!) And the people here are friendly too. We were lucky enough to get free blueberry cake from them :),1,1
"Pull up a chair, son and let me tell you about The Scrambler.  It begins, like so many breakfasts do, with a plate of hashbrowns and about four scrambled eggs.  But that's just the start.  Sprinkle those eggs with your choice of meat (bacon, ham, or sausage) and cover the whole thing with cheese.  Wait, you think we're done?  Not yet, boyo.  There's still some sausage gravy to top the whole thing off.    All this with a milkshake.  Consistently voted best breakfast in the Big Ten, it's the perfect hang-over food.",1,1
"The most unhealthy place I have ever eaten. The scrambler is insane! Eggs + meat + cheese. Oh my lord it's huge. If you can handle the cholesterol spike, go.",1,1
"What once was a bi-weekly weekend breakfast staple in my undergraduate years, now is a faint memory of coffee malts, scramblers of old, and nostalgic-tasting (mediocre) coffee in just as nostalgic of a mug.  The cash-only, stand-and-wait-for-days line, is part of the experience. I recall shivering fall and winter Sunday mornings after a Saturday of exhausting UW Marching Band  insanity, longing for a coffee malt and hot coffee on the side.   Favorites include the legendary scrambler: Green peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar and pepper jack cheese with gravy on the side and Frank's hot sauce. My mouth waters instantly at the the thought!  Coffee cake is yummy, malts and shakes are out of this world tasty, pancakes are classic and plate-size (try the chocolate chip and banana walnut combined, if they still offer walnuts...just ask!). French toast is standard and sweet to the max!   And lest we not forget, Mickies DOES have lunch/dinner options, even if they're not open late! A late morning cheeseburger or reuben? You're darn tootin'!  If you're looking for pristine, uber-clean, and snazzy. Go away. The charm of Mickies is it's long line, 'whad'l'ya have"" staff that doesn't have time to chit chat, and stick-to-your-ribs Midwestern diner-style breakfast.  Go. Go now. Go later. Go yesterday. Just go!",1,1
Had a dream last night about their homemade strawberry rhubarb coffee cake...  And strong coffee too!,1,1
"Not only huge portions, but also delicious food. The service is quick. Even during weekend lunch time, the wait time was reasonable and the service was very homely. The attendant helped to get right dishes - based on the dietary preferences. The only flipside is : they accept ONLY cash...Overall hidden gem (may be known only UW students)",1,1
Excellent service and the food was amazing. Came in at first opening and had the Scrambler with bacon. Absolutely fantastic.,1,1
"Get... - a milkshake (a good, old fashioned milkshake, not something you'd get at culverts)  - the griddle pancake (I don't even like pancakes, but these are the bomb diggity!) ...and you'll love this place.   The scrambler and the omelettes are alright, average diner food. Their sweet potato fries are just ok as well, but the fact that Mickey's serves sweet potato fries at all is at least a step in the right direction.",1,1
"Awesome place! We fed two adults and one child for $11, and filled our to-go box. Servings are huge and the food is pretty good, not too greasy. Oh, and only order one pancake, they are big!",1,1
"Go early. Friendly, helpful waitstaff, reasonable prices, slightly overwhelming menu. The scrambler and yanks are really good, as is the coffee and OJ. Friends liked the corned beef hash.",1,1
"Before this past Saturday, I have never waited outside of Mickies and have considered myself extremely fortunate.  During my last trip, our group had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Our table was crammed up to the radiator next to the main window.  There were people bumping into us everywhere.  I LOVE MICKIES!  Our service has been prompt in the past.  During this trips ""swamped"" time, our service was not slacked at all.  Our waitress (who my wife and I have had several times before) was legitimately happy to see us and kept our drinks filled the entire time despite the hectic population.  For breakfast (though it was lunch time, I can not live without breakfast) the Scrambler is king.  Do it any way you want.  You can not lose at Mickies.  As long as this cornerstone of Madison is here, I will be a happy patron.",1,1
"Old-fashioned, no-nonsense diner.  Has the old menus on the walls.  Can sit on a swivel stool at the counter.  I got the omelet special which came with a too-big portion of home fries and coffee.  Very tasty.  I'd go back again when I'm in town, and staying at Hotel Red next door. Cash-only!",1,1
"Love the old school charm of the place! Had a corn bread pancake, a serve of griddle and the reuben omelette. The omelette comes highly recommended and it does live up to its reputation! Friendly service and homely atmosphere. It's cash only though.",1,1
"Mickies sure is great... friendly staff, large amounts of food and decent prices. I always eat too much and feel sick after (which isn't their fault, I just need to chew more)",1,1
"Busy place, there may be a waiting line.  Cash only and four of us ate at the counter ...starting with homemade blueberry and an apple cinnamon coffee cake.... they both were delicious!  The breakfast scrambler with the gravy was quite amazing; the pancake I would not recommend; corn beef hash was quite enjoyable; the French toast was good, yet eggy; the omelette made to order was quite large and tasty for the price.  If I were in the area again I would go back in a heartbeat!",1,1
I used to go to Hubbard Ave for breakfast. This is now my #1.,1,1
"Just had spectacular mid morning breakfast, Scrambler! Shared it with my daughter who is checking out campus. We got blueberry crumb cake to go bc we didn't have room for more. My favorite things were our very friendly waitress and that we didn't smell like breakfast when we left! Great ventilation!",1,1
"OMG! OMG! I fell in love with this place as soon as I walked in.  I don't think the place has been remodeled since the 40's and Mickies, please don't, it looks fab. I started out with the Chili Mac Soup, OMG it's the best I ever had.  My eldest got the Milk Shake, pancakes and tatters, I got the scrambler.  OMG, OMG the food was HUGE!  I am a big gal and I could not even finish half of my meal. The pancakes could wrap a mans hands they were so big.  They serve Pepsi products which is an excellent choice.  The waitress we had was friendly and help me with my order.  I just love this place!",1,1
"I have 1 word for you: Scrambler! This place is great. A tucked in little ""old time"" cafe. some of the best big plate breakfast choices you will find in the Madison area. I always get the signature breakfast item, the Scrambler.  It is multiple eggs combined with your choice of 1 item (or more for extra) including but not limited to, sausage, bacon, peppers, onion, mushroom....you name it pretty much and they will throw it in this fantastic concoction. All this on top of yanks (sliced soft potato's) covered is brown breakfast gravy and a ton of cheese!!!!!!!!! With bread. A ton of cheese, yes please!!!!!!!!!! A word to the wise, prepare yourself for a wait to sit down on the weekend, and football season is mad crazy since this little cafe is next to Camp Randall. On the week day, you should be just fine getting a decent booth seat.  Fast service all the time, even when they are packed full.  If your in Madison, you have to hit this place up for Breakfast!",1,1
"Huge portions!!! Their scramblerd are extremely big! I can usually take some to go. their milkshakes are tasty as well. There's  usually a line of you go at brunch time, but anytime after 1 there's no wait. Remember its cash only",1,1
"Given name by a student. Sat at the counter. In a nutshell, the scrambler was awesome and I couldn't finish mine. Cash only but worth the stop at the ATM prior to waiting in the quick moving line outside.",1,1
"This place has a very unique old school atmosphere.  I had the scrambler which was giant and good!  More than a grown man can eat in one sitting.  They only take cash; however, there is an ATM for you to use.",1,1
"It IS as good as everyone says! Especially those heavenly pancakes! There's more to this place than just the tradition, the food really is great. I have had the red fish sandwich, BLT, corned beef, Reuben, burger, strawberry pancakes, banana pancakes and cheese curds. Everything is delicious and you get your food FAST.",1,1
"I came here with the BF for breakfast and was expecting the worst since I'm not really a fan of these counter style breakfast places where everyone seats themselves and are packed in like sardines. When we got there it was utter chaos but the gods must have been watching over us because we spotted a hidden empty table and sat down immediately (much to the dismay of the other people who were waiting and didn't see the table bwahahaha). Our waitress was super friendly and reminded me of Sarah Palin (I didn't hold that against her). The BF ordered the Scrambler with bacon and sausage with a small glass of chocolate milk. I was shocked by how much food that was and was even more shocked by how delicious it turned out. I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage and home fries. These were the biggest, most dense pancakes ever. I was very proud that I was able to almost finish one of those beasts. I took the rest to go and enjoyed them later as a post breakfast/pre lunch snack. All in all we were both very pleased by our meal and the price was very reasonable considering how much food we got.",1,1
"Ah, the coffee cake!! I miss the blueberry coffee cake so bad .. I haven't had it in a while. You can taste the ""home-made"" and ""they know what they're doing"" in the coffee cake.   I've also eaten breakfast there. I had a giant oriental omelet with ""yankee"" (hash brown type of thing) on the side. As it was suggested, I had the omelet with soy-sauce ... it makes sense with the ""oriental omelet,"" right? So right. I loved it. My friend's gynormous  pancake was moist and fluffy and delicious, too. Both of us couldn't finish our meal, so we the took the rest of it home.   If you plan to be there on a weekend morning, go early, otherwise bunch of hung overs like yourselves are going to be there and the wait can be pretty long.",1,1
"This diner-style joint is at the center of food quality, service, and value for your money. It might not be the type of place you would take a special guest, but it's a great stop over on a lazy Sunday morning with family or friends.  The scrambler is always good, and big enough to split between two people. Pancakes are giant-sized, cakey, and make excellent leftovers. My go-to items are the blueberry coffee cake, a side of bacon, and the refillable coffee. I can always count on the coffee. Game days are usually really crowded, but the line moves along pretty quickly.",1,1
"It's so simple, or so it seems... but it's amazing how many people manage to screw up eggs, meat, potatoes, pancakes, french toast, and the rest of the breakfast experience. For what it serves, Mickies Dairy Bar does it perfectly... every single time.",1,1
"If you want to time travel a bit, put Mickies on your list. Just make sure you get there early, because this Madison institution often has a line out the door.   There's not a whole lot that's changed about Mickies since it opened in the 40s; the booths and counter look original, and the prices are still quite low (though they have gone up considerably from the original menu board offering breakfasts from 20-50 cents).   Things I can pretty much guarantee: - it'll be busy - you'll leave full - your items will be made fresh and won't come from a container - you won't regret the milkshake you just ordered with your breakfast  I'm serious about that last point - this is the only place where it feels right to enjoy a creamy blend of milk and ice cream along with your bacon and eggs.   There's a reason Mickies has been open continuously for nearly 60 years; go see why for yourself.",1,1
"I've heard a ton about Mickies since I've moved to Madison, and I'm glad i finally got to try it out! It's an old-styled diner, and fairly cheap for the huge portions. I highly recommend trying out the Scrambler, which is basically just a huge mixed portion of breakfast foods. I've never seen anything like it before in any brunch diner, so that was really unique! I personally got French Toast topped with strawberries, which was delicious!  It's always pretty busy - I went at 11 AM on a pretty snowy day, and I got one of the last booths available. I would always expect a bit of a wait if you're going around brunch time, but I think it's well worth it. Perhaps with a few more visits, I would be able to put this at 5 stars!   Finally, I've heard their shakes are amazing, so I would certainly try them out if you're a fan of shakes! Would definitely recommend trying it out if you're in town and want a quick brunch!",1,1
"This is a pancake-enthusiasts heaven, at least in my opinion. The banana nut pancakes are just divine- I've ate a lot of pancakes in my days and these are like my absolute favorite. Dense, moist, delicious. I've had a bit of the scrambler, stolen bites from family members, and that tastes just as amazing as the pancakes.  Would 100% recommend this place to all Madisonians, Wisconsinites and all Americans, in general.  Good coffee, good service. Only thing is- remember cash!  Mickie's will always be my go-to breakfast place in Madison.",1,1
"Hands down, this is the best breakfast/brunch place in all of Madison (because I've never been there for dinner).  If you're looking for a big, hearty breakfast at a cheap price, Mickies Dairy Bar is the way to go. I highly recommend the scrambler, a huge egg-fiasco with your choice of ingredients. By the way, it's huge. But, truth be told, anything and everything on their breakfast menu is fabulous. I love the banana cinnamon nut pancakes, the steak and eggs, the french toast, and their omelettes (forgot which omelettes I had, but I assure you they're all good).  Anyways, my advice is to go to Mickies Dairy Bar with an empty stomach and a hungry appetite because sometimes you might just want to order more than one thing. I will forewarn you that you might have to wait a bit on Saturday mornings, but it'll be worth it for sure.",1,1
"This has long been a favorite for me, and is now so for my son as well. Standing order if a buttermilk pancake, bacon, fruit, and OJ for him and it's the perfect size breakfast for a growing boy. Standing order for me is a cornmeal pancake, patty sausage, yanks with onions and jalapenos, and an iced tea. I usually have some left overs, which is fine because it's such an affordable place. It's an old place with TONS of character (some of which is not great...tiny bathroom...). We always try to sit at the counter, but frequently the restaurant is PACKED and you may not have a choice of where to sit. As long as you party isn't too large and the line isn't too long it's probably worth waiting, but good luck on game day.   When I was working on campus I used to pop in here for lunch about once a week or so and it was always great for lunch as well. Soups were delicious, hearty, and warming on those cold winter days; highly recommended.   Really I've enjoyed most everything I've had at Mickies and never been there with anyone that felt differently. The one exception may be the french toast, which was VERY eggy.   It's a 'greasy spoon' in all the right ways. Definitely worth a look!",1,1
Awesome! Be warned.... must bring cash!!! But don't worry there is an atm right outside. Parking was a bit of a pain. If you find a spot. Park and walk there. Otherwise you'll be circling.  The portions are huge!!!! We had leftovers. Really this was a bang for your buck. Our waiter was not quite awake yet but did an awesome job. Friendly people. One note is the menu is on the wall and it's seat yourself. Enjoy that American diner feel with most dishes for breakfast at least under $10. Classic.,1,1
My best friend brought me here one morning while I was visiting her in Madison- we basically stuffed ourselves silly. She ordered the scrambler and I ordered chocolate pancakes. We both got milkshakes with her breakfast because which were delicious and thick. We arrived early before a rush and could see the line going up the street for people waiting to eat. Definitely want to visit again. The staff was friendly and helpful. Cash only too FYI.,1,1
We usually go to Stacks  and wanted to try something new.  This is a great breakfast spot. Expect to wait a while but worth it.  Omelettes and pancakes were excellent.  Portions are massive.  Shakes are good.  Try the cinnamon roll!! The inside is cramped and bathroom is nasty so be forewarned.  Staff was really friendly. Great value.  Definitely will repeat.,1,1
"Best Breakfast and Bang for Your Buck  Well there is no way that this joint is not 5 Stars. I've been here once and I don't care I feel confident with my assessment. Friendly service, huge portions, and very wallet/Purse friendly. I'm not going to long winded with this review because this is simple folks. pancakes bigger than my hand see my pic. Some of the best home made  cornbeef hash I had and the price is crazy cheap. More beef than hash for sure. A meal like this at home in Ft. Lauderdale with the portion served to me would cost at least 18 to 20 bucks. Easy. Here with coffee $12.25. The buttermilk pancake was nice and fluffy and I just put syrup on it and no butter and it was excellent.   Ambiance.  No nonsense mom and pop old style joint goes to college.   That about sums it up.  Verdict  You should already be walking, biking, running, taking a cab, a bus or driving here before you finish reading my review. LOL.  Stay Hungry!",1,1
Always must stop in for Sunday breakfast on our Madison visits to the Arboretum.  Everything the prepare is amazing & the ambiance is the best experience,1,1
"Thanks to our FL neighbor, a Wi Native, we came! Just the ambiance itself is worth the stop. Love the 1950's signs & prices ;) I'm doing a (Thank God! It's HUGE) Banana Nut Pancake, my husband got the Egg & Pork Chop special...no way we finished either of them. The pancake was enormous with an abundance of nuts & banana slices. His pork chops (2) were tender & delicious. Why would college students sign up for the meal plan? Their folks should just send them here! Lots of character - even the ladies room. This is a must-do WI spot (after finding all the FLW structures)",1,1
Large portions! Especially the scrambler the pancakes were good very large good selection of sandwiches also. They only accept cash. Go at an off time so you don't have to wait in line. Good shakes and the waiters are friendly. Nice cozy atmosphere.,1,1
This place is so cool! James my 10 year old and I stopped here for pancakes and they were just yummy!  Atmosphere is very old school cafe with red stools and checkerboard flooring.. The menu is on boards over the pick up area in the kitchen.  Our waitress Stephanie was quick and super friendly.  We will be back!,1,1
"Banana nut pancakes were huge...should have ordered just one (and I am a big man - 6'4"").  Loved the cinnamon rolls, which had the perfect amount of frosting and were fresh and warm. ..perfect with the cup of joe.  My wife had an omelette made to order...not too bad.  The home fries were a bit heavy and ""mealy"" - I like mine crispy on the outside.  Overall, a great amount of good food for the dollar.",1,1
"Ate breakfast here with some UW friends before we drove back to Illinois because they hyped it up quite a bit. Boy, did it live up to the hype! It's definitely a no-frills place, but when the food and service are so good you really don't need any other bells and whistles.  Ordered a scrambler with corned beef. It was awesome and the portion was huge! It was literally enough food for 3 meals. The price was well worth it and service was quick and friendly. The huge pile of leftovers I had still tasted good for dinner that day!  Would recommend this place if you're looking for a good breakfast in Madison! I heard it gets pretty busy a lot of the time, but if you can get a spot it's worth it!",1,1
Great food.  Huge portions.  Quick service.  Amazing prices.  There is good reason why people line up out the door to get in,1,1
If Mickies was not on campus I am not sure if it would make it like it does but it fits perfectly into student world. Huge mounds of food for cheap and seat yourself atmosphere that makes this place feel perfect for any poor college student or alum who wants to pretend they are still in school. The fact that they do not take credit cards is a pain but only adds to the feel of the place. Somehow it all feels right at Mickies.,1,1
"On this (of many past) occasion I got 2 huge whole grain pancakes and a monster sized veggie omelet with toast for just a bit over $12 and it was amazing! Filling is an understatement! It hit the spot and then some lets just say that much. Plate sized, hot thick pancakes full of fluffy flapjack goodness on one plate and then a plain omelet stuffed with 6, yes 6 veggies (of my choosing) on the other. Service was fast and friendly despite a fairly busy Thursday morning (8am) I was please with this experience on many levels! It saddens me to be relocating 2000 miles away by the end of the month for work! I will miss Mickies dearly!",1,1
"Love this place! Unfortunately my pancakes are sometimes undercooked, but otherwise everything else is really good and service is surprisingly fast considering how busy they are.",1,1
"Worth the lines.  Try the scrambler--remember to share it with another person, it's nearly impossible to finish yourself.  Can't go wrong with anything off their menu here.  Cash only, tip well!",1,1
"Easily my favourite breakfast place in Madison. Portions of food are plentiful, staff is friendly, and it's right by Camp Randall. If you get there early enough their cinnamon rolls are. I definitely recommend the scrambler (3 eggs, your choice of ingredients, and breakfast potatoes underneath).",1,1
"Pb milkshake, blueberry pancakes, and the scrambler. All delicious and it was a ton of food!",1,1
"Being from NYC, you never get to see this kind of restaurant.  The whole neighborhood, college town, friendly, homegrown atmosphere is very lovely and hard to come by.  As early as we came on a Sunday and with a party of 2, we still had to wait for a seat.  Anything more than 2 would've been hard to get a table for.  We took our seats at the breakfast and were quickly greeted with coffee and a friendly smile.  The menu is simple American breakfast food; you get your eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc.  It's wonderful to see the original menu still up on the wall from oh so many years ago.  We took the plunge on the scrambler.  SHARE THIS!  It was such a huge dish for one person, almost to point of wastefulness.  We made sure to share so we won't end up hating our meal.  We ended the meal with a shake to go.    Nothing but good feelings about this place for a big breakfast and hometown feel.",1,1
"A Madison favorite, spitting distance from Camp Randall. My favorite is the Ruben omelette. Great coffee.",1,1
My favorite brunch place in Madison! Has the best coffee in the world! The scarmbler is very tasty and large portion. It is always crowded on weekends,1,1
"I haven't lived in Madison for 10 years, but I still fantasize about the Scrambler and the blueberry pancakes.  I lived at the Regent and this is where I'd sober up after a night out or fuel up after a row.    Your best bet is to get there early.  You'll want to stand over tables like a hawk, gawking at the patrons as if to say ""Come on, finish that last bite and get out of here so I can have your table.""  Actually make them feel uncomfortable.  They will leave.  You will eat.  All will be well.  My first time at Mickey's I learned about the pancakes from an Indiana fan.  He was there for an away football game.  He ordered pancakes and put them into plastic ziplocks to bring back to Indiana for his wife.  Yes, they are that good.",1,1
"Love it- its like a trip back to the 50's (I think?)  If you are a diner fan, you should make a stop here. Even if not, who doesn't like the occasional greasy spoon?  The breakfast here is great and classic. Scramblers are a good choice.  FYI - It gets really busy on weekend mornings.",1,1
"I always go for the scrambler,milk shakes, and coffee for Sunday brunch.  Really cozy diner which is unique to Madison.",1,1
"I could write a review with just three words....and they would be: Try the scrambler.   But alas, I'm honest and have to say I've really never had the scrambler at Mickies. Oh I've seen plenty of them but I always chose to order their delicious pancakes instead. So, on that note, order pancakes. Any flavor will do, they are all incredible. Special attention should be paid to their pumpkin variety when in season.   As others have said, the food is quite affordable, service very sweet (a la your grandmother's kitchen) and man it can get crowded on the weekends. And if you're feeling really great one day, definitely get a milkshake. Mmmmm.",1,1
"Had the opportunity the finally go to Mickie's dairy bar. Wow what a place! Love the diner atmosphere,eating at the counter close quarters, the buzz of the customers enjoying their delicious food. To those who have been dining there for decades or even weeks, this is nothing new.  But for me a first time customer....Wow Great atmosphere,great food and great people. Going to eat there often.",1,1
Good: 1: Hot babes! 2: Delicious wings & fries! 3: Cheap ice cold brewskies! 4: Fun casino! 5: Coupons in Las Vegas Advisor and North American Casino Guide.  Bad: 1: Pool area gutted: being renovated. 2: Long walk to restaurant. 3: Mad Onion only open weekends. 4: Player Club under previous owner was more generous.,1,1
I love hooters. I have stayed hear quite a few times. I have no complaints. Everyones really nice and we got a awesome deal on the room price.,1,1
"People that complain about this place has champaign taste with beer money.     It's a really nice place for $20 a night.     24 hour pool, you can't beat that!",1,1
It's cheap! Duh! That's the whole reason we stayed here... Plenty of other things in Vegas are expensive... Why shell out for a bed and pillow! That being said... The room was kind of gross and run down. But the bed was comfy. The casino is small but we had a fun time playing in it. Basically you get what you pay for here. And that's all right with me. We would more than likely stay again.,1,1
"2pm lunch, good service. We got the 50 pieces wings and sause on the side. Spring Break 2014!!",1,1
The new manager Chris that  I met last week was a huge help and super cheerful. Probably one of the best managers they have had in a while. Keep up the great work bud!,1,1
"I was hammered when I got here and we wandered right in for 25 cent wings after midnight. We ordered 150 of them and fed the homeless guy who was next to us. We left full and happy and as we walked out, they were blaring Journey, so we scream-sang at the top of our lungs.  The girls weren't any better or worse than the rest of the strip and the inside looks like, duh, a Hooters. If you don't know what you're signing on for here, go elsewhere.",1,1
"The hotel itself was dated, but they do have decent restaurant and nice looking girls.  With the price you are paying, you won't get a five star ambience, come on, 80 (including the resort fee) per day or less for a low season.  The only caution I would give is that some customers who stay there don't look normal.  But other than that, nice girls, nice pool, ok food, ok casino.  What more can you ask for living a block away from strip and paying less than half of the price of most hotels' or motels' costs?  I can guarantee that motel 6 or howard johnsons are most definitely not comparable to here.  It is safe to live here and convenient if you happen to need to come to Vegas for business trip or just for weekend get away..",1,1
"First of all.. you get what you pay for. I got a room for 3 nights for about $130  I've stayed here about 4 different times and it always delivers.  -OK rooms. -Not bad service. Ive never had any problems. -The food is ok, of course -Stay here during the summer and the pool is fun. BBQ and not that crowded. - The pool is real close to the elevators so you dont have to take that huge walk through the casino/lobby like other casinos.  - People go there to party, so its just that. Not so much a family place. - And most of all the location is just the best for its price.",1,1
"Had a one night stay on our way out of Vegas. Very affordable. room was a little dated and the beds very small but it was clean, had a great view of the pools, all 5 of them. the casino is small and there was only one poker table that was full almost the entire time we were there so no way to play. The food was typical bar food and typically good. Service was good and not a long wait time. its a little pricey but in Vegas you expect to pay a little more. the casino employees were pretty friendly even when they aren't the best at the jobs. they were still nice. There is a good variety of slots to chose from and we would stay here again, just next time get two king rooms. At the price they charge it is affordable to do so",1,1
Not bad at all for the price - they do charge resort fees on top of your room purchase. Walking distance to the south end of the strips. Breakfast was pretty good. Got noisy neighbors two days in a row but you get what you paid for.,1,1
"The Aliante has changed hands and the buffet is no longer managed by the Station chain and has changed it's name from 'Feast' to 'Medley'.  Definitely a change for the better!!  We tried the old Station buffet a couple times and decided not to go back.  The fall in the quality and selection in the offerings at the Cannery prompted us to try Aliante again.  Excellent quality, lunch is only $7.95 (!) and vast selection including a couple carving stations and a barbecue station that would be acceptable in a BBQ joint.  We always liked the look of the Aliante, now their food measures up, Try it!",1,1
"Tons of selection, piping hot, so hot the tongs are too hot to touch. Their price is really cheap for the huge selection, everything tasted good. Their chicken mushroom alfredo was my favorite as you could really taste their mushroom sauce, their spaghetti marinara was really tasty, their chinese sesame balls were the best, just like dim sum but hot and tasty, in perfect shape even after sitting for a long time! Their fried gyoza dumplings were perfect, spiced just right, great asian flavor, even their spring rolls were great with tons of tasty meat. Their guacamole was fabulous and their ice cream was really smooth and delicious. Would definitely come back, the price is right, the atmosphere asian style and comfortable, I didn't want to leave. Staff were very nice and overall great for the price!",1,1
"You can't go wrong here for breakfast. Omlettes made to order and the service is great. They guy Jose that makes the omlettes is great always on point when making mines. Can't go wrong for the value on this. 4.99 with players cards.....All good...Just so you know im sure it was mentioned here on some review...Its no longer a STATIONS CASINO, and no longer called FEAST BUFFET its now MEDLEY BUFFET.",1,1
"Affordable, nice staff, and not as crowded as buffets on the strip. Have had the dinner buffet twice and have yet to be disappointed!",1,1
"TIME SPENT 3 Lunchtime meals 1 Dinnertime meal  LAYOUT spacious, comfy seating, good selection of foods.  SERVICE/FOOD they USE to serve all you can eat Snow Crab, but i don't know what happened.   either way, i've always enjoyed eating at the Aliante...  NOTE* Aliante/Feast Buffet -- loves it's military members on Veterans Day as the meal is free.^^  PRICING average cost...  think $25.??  CLOSING Aliante does a good job of balancing price and selection.   -1 Star until you reinstate Snow Crab Legs.^^;",1,1
Me and my husband come every Friday night for seafood night because $20 for all you can eat crab is a great price considering how fresh it always is! And their ice cream bar has about 10 different flavors of scooped ice cream and  they are delicious!,1,1
"This buffet has a wide range of all kinds of delicious food. You can't beat the price. If you are a fan of menudo then this buffet has the best in town. Chunks of tripe loaded with flavor, add lemon onions you can go wrong. I come 3 times a week.",1,1
This buffet is consistently good I have eaten here probably 8-9 times and have enjoyed it each time. The staff is on top of the food presentation and friendly too. I will eat here many more times!,1,1
Went for brunch recently with visiting family. Staff very accommodating with toddler & seating. Server prompt & attentive when leaky beverage glass appeared.  Food was plentiful & tasty.,1,1
"The best place in town for weekend brunch.Only 11 dollars a person! Fresh omelets made to order,carving station,shrimp,awesome biscuits and gravy,and all you can drink champagne! A bit out of the way for me,but it's worth it",1,1
"Get the Aliante Players Club for discount on buffet.  I've eaten at this buffet since the hotel opened and prices are very reasonable, especially for food variety.  You can enjoy Barbeque, Asian, American Fare, Italian, salads, and a nice variety of desserts and gelato.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Go to the company website to check for Dining Promotions.  Special Nights include:  Tuesday - Hawaiian Pig Roast Night Thursday - Live Pasta Friday - Seafood Saturday - Steak",1,1
"The breakfast choices were so so. But I suppose it's what you get for $8.99. Just when I thought I was only going to eat one plate of decent food (home fries, chorizo eggs, spinach with eggs, and mini waffles), they started putting out lunch! Yay for us for being typically late to everything. We were able to get some lunch items but I was more excited about dessert! They had some delicious chewy cookies and a wide variety of ice cream. Super yum!",1,1
The Aliante buffet has improved a lot since being apart from the Station Casinos.  The quality of the food has improved and the workers seem to be more service oriented.  It's a good value for the food you get.,1,1
Finally got a chance to do lunch and dinner here. I don't think you can go anywhere and beat the prices $7.99 and $9.99! I consider Aliante and GVR the best Feast Buffets in the Valley. The food is not bland. The roast beef is off the hook! The mash potatoes have pepper corns and they taste like butter unlike harden flour lumps I've had at other Feast Buffets. The salad bar at Aliante is always full of choices and the desserts are yummy.,1,1
"One of  my favorite places to visit when in the Aliante area. Price is very reasonable and most importantly, the service is great. I usually go either on a Saturday or Sunday morning, I always ask for my favorite waitress, Letty. She is quick, super friendly and great to all her customers.   Food is good. Again, you have to keep in mind this is a buffet and price is extremely reasonable. In my opinion, their buffet is much better than other breakfast buffets I've tired in town. Always satisfied.",1,1
I love this place their always so nice and I just got a free random act of kindness drink,1,1
"I LOVE Jamba Juice. I just never get around to going here as often as I would like. Also, I make my own smoothies at home (saves a bit of money). However, when I really feel like taking myself to Jamba it is never a disappointment.  Honestly I can never really remember which smoothies I get. I tend to hop all over the menu mostly because I like all fruit and I don't have anything I really can't stand.   And just to be clear - they have amazing oatmeal. Oh I love it so much. Steel cut oats with fruit and other toppings. Don't say it isn't good - it is!   I love that they also have the wheatgrass shots here. They are amazingly refreshing and good for you. Try one if you haven't yet.   This particular JJ has a nice staff, very accommodating and helpful. They're right outside a gym so I assume hey have to get quite busy at peak times, but whenever I get in here there's only a few patrons or none at all. I hope that doesn't mean they will be going anywhere anytime soon because it is the closest smoothie/juice bar to my house!",1,1
"I like this location and I find the team there inviting and friendly.  I ordered my drink and the young lady brought it to my table.  The only thing that prevents me form giving it a 5 star rating is the WiFi set-up.  You have to ask for a login and code.  They should do what Starbucks does, you must agree to terms and conditions.  But that is the ONLY negative for this location, and in the great scheme of things it is minute. I go here when ever I am on this side of town.",1,1
"Staff was knowledgeable and very friendly, order was done just right, without very much wait, great experience.",1,1
"Mmm, I had the dreamsicle and it was so good. They are really friendly at this Jamba Juice, a bunch of happy campers I say. They have breakfast burritos too, I'll be back and you should go too.",1,1
"Jamba Juice constitutes 1/3 of my daily nutrition.  Since sitting down and eating is a luxury for a grad student, I must now imbibe food if I am to survive regular human hours.  My personal usuals are: protein berry workout with the whey and soy boost, and acai anti-oxident with the energy boost.  I also take 3 3G charger shots (120 mg caffeine each) to keep my eyes open though the day and a 1 oz wheatgrass shot to make sure I get something green into my body.    This is the best Jamba Juice in town, the workers are friendly, get the orders right and promptly.",1,1
"Yeah Buddy!!! I hit up this place at least 2 times a week if not more. Very friendly staff and the drinks are always grrrreat! I always get the same(Mango Mantra) but i always ask what other drinks they would recomend and one day i may even try one, one day!",1,1
"Nice, clean spot located nearby the airport on your way to your new destination. .. Fresh Juice, Fresh,  nice people... get your healthy on :-)  Your constant companion,   ~deirdra",1,1
"One of if not the best Jamba Juice location I have ever been to. Friendly, fast, clean and cold it's good to having a cooling place here in this horrible heat of Vegas.",1,1
"Clean. Courteous. Delicious servings. Typical, no fuss Jamba Juice!",1,1
I pick up a Jamba Juice 2x a week for my son and me after I pick him up from preschool. I love the healthy benefits and he loves his fruity snack. I always add the vitamin c booster to help fight off those school germs. :-)   The staff are always friendly too.,1,1
"All their workers seem to love their job.  The girls are sweet.  I've been ere three times as my Friend is a regular.  Service is quick and drinks are good.    It's always clean and the interior is nice.  If you tip the servers, they yell ""TIP TIP HOORAY"".  Cute :] haha",1,1
Love that this is right by my house! Service is always super friendly. I'm in and out in minutes which is rare in a smoothie place. My smoothies always taste great!,1,1
I love Jamba Juice and will have breakfast here daily when I am staying in a town that is lucky enough to have one.,1,1
Oh Jamba! One of my favorite smoothie places and my favorite choice as of right now because tropical smoothie is horrible in every category.  The staff here are super nice and patient! They also apologize when they are taking a bit too long which is so so so kind! I hate the customers who are so rude to the workers because they are really doing their best. The location is super clean and they haven't messed up any of my orders! I work up the street so I basically live here for lunch.   My favorite is their mango power bowls/acai bowls and literally all their smoothies!  Thanks Jamba for being such a great boyfriend to me :),1,1
"I HEART Jamba Juice!  The smoothies are fresh, delicious & taste so yummy.  My perfect treat in the morning is a Mango smoothie with a piping hot bowl of oatmeal w/ brown sugar and bananas.   I love this Jamba location because they consistently have the best service.  Always kind & friendly.  Tip Tip..Hooray!!!",1,1
Love this place...  Today original  orange dream... Parmesan pretzel and a bottle of water... Perfect way to start the day - when ever I need a boost of energy. I come to Jamba Juice and have a energy boost in my favorite drink... They have all kinds of  yummy drinks - there even serving coffee and tea,1,1
"This is my favorite Jamba Juice location!  One may ask how a place like this stands out if it's part of a chain because they all try to follow the same standards. However, what makes this location different from the rest is the fact that if you order your drink fix with an extra boost they will automatically upgrade you to the next size drink (for free)! Paying for the extra boost is actually cheaper than paying for the larger size. I tried this at other locations and none of them do it except this one (total turn off).   I haven't been here for awhile and was unaware of the happy 2 for $5, untill Christina O. had mentioned it. And now that I do know makes me like Jamba Juice even more because other smoothie places can't beat that deal.    Since it is in a new plaza (McCarren Market Place) everything inside is brand spanking new, which is nice. Compared to other locations I think this one is one of the bigger ones. And the staff here are super friendly. I love the fact this is the closest Jamba to me. I've been here multiple times and I have never had a problem.  Peach Pleasure FTW!!!",1,1
"The best Jamba Juice in Vegas!! Make sure you ask for Romeo he has great customer service, great personality and is very knowledgeable about everything they offer. This Jamba Juice is always clean, everyone's smiling and the energy is uplifting like the smoothies. I usually come here once and week and will definitely keep coming. Check it out if you're in the area!",1,1
"I haven't been to this particular location of Jamba Juice  in awhile due to the very unfriendly staff in about a couple of years. But coming back to the area I decided to give it another shot and my experience was accurate quick and friendly!!! Like wow what a turn around. And there actually was a line of people waiting. Before it was stoic in here but now it's lively. The gentleman with the long hair was great,",1,1
"This Jamba Juice is very large and the service is really friendly and efficient. Like most locations, the menu is extensive. The store is often not very busy making it a great spot to sit, enjoy a drink and chat with friends.",1,1
I've only been here a handful of times yet every time I have it's always quiet. Therefore that means no lines. No lines means quick service. The Kona Berry Blast was really yummy. Highly recommended.,1,1
You know... it's Jamba Juice. Not much to add. It's good when it's hot outside.,1,1
As far as smoothie shops go this place deserves five stars.  I've been here several times over the last couple months and the drinks are always consistently good and the service is always top notch.  Top notch service at places like this is often hard to find but it seems this location has been able to retain employees who actually care about their jobs.  What else is there to say?  It's a smoothie shop with a boat load of options and great service...check it out!,1,1
Friendly staff. The smoothies are delicious. But what I enjoy the most is their  blueberry steel cut oatmeal.,1,1
"As stated by other reviews, the staff here are always friendly, prompt, and offer great customer service. They're always nice when I ask for a small cup for my toddler too so she has her own, which she loves!",1,1
There were two guys working this morning and were very friendly. My smoothie was made perfectly and I was happy to give this location my service base on the great customer service.,1,1
"I LOVE Jamba Juice. Like, obsessive, must-have-or-can-not-function, love. I have it every morning. The smoothies and matcha shots are delicious and awesome, all in themselves, but the amazing staff here is what makes this my regular go-to store. I will drive out of my way, directly past other stores, to get to have my 5 minutes of morning pick-me-up with these guys. They know my order, are always friendly and no matter how busy it is, always take the time to ask how my morning is going or recommend something on the menu I might like. Thanks for always being a bright spot in my mornings guys!",1,1
"Ok, this one takes a close second to Tropical Smoothie Cafe, but it is more convenient to my house. Food items differ greatly between the two competing smoothie places. I've never tried the food here but some things look appealing: flatbreads, oatmeal, and meal smoothies. Basically, we come here for the smoothies. The good thing about this place is that there is a three size menu for the smoothies: sixteen, original, & power. (Like Tropical Smoothie Cafe, weekdays feature Happy Hour- upgrade to power size for less than a dollar- Sold!) Another plus, take out menus here include nutritional information. Another thing to mention is the many  varieties: all fruit, jamba light, blended with a purpose, classics, creamy treats, and iced tead fruit infusions- and boost options, thirteen to be exact, like energy boost, soy protein, and weight burner.  My husband's favorite smoothie here is the Peanut Butter Moo'd (creamy treat), which is also featured in the 'Don't Eat That"" section in those popular books ""Eat this, Not that"", due to high calorie & fat content. I've tried the all fruit smoothies but something was lacking (one of the mango ones could of used some nonfat yogurt). Maybe the low calorie focus was the tradeoff, but I decided to try other flavors. The Pomegranate Paradise is made with pomegranate juice, strawberries, mangos, and peaches. I really liked it but my husband said it was a little sour. With 3.5 servings of fruit, it's easy to get your daily 6-9 daily recommended fruits/veggies. My husband got the Aloha Pineapple- pineapple juice, strawberries, bananas, pineapple sherbet, and nonfat plain yogurt. His tasted really sweet compared to mine. I will try other ones since there are summer specials. I love the variety.    Summer (only) deals include: Mondays- 12 oz meal smoothies $3, Tuesdays- 16 oz. alll fruit smoothies $3, Wednesdays- $2 oatmeal, Thursdays- $1 off Tea & Coffee smoothies, Fridays- $1 baked good with purchase of any menu drink.",1,1
Awesome service!! Love the Kona Berry Bowl!!,1,1
"The BEST Jamba Juice in LV! I love the fruit juices w/ginger. Everyone is always so pleasant and equally make a great smoothie. I've been coming here for a while and my favorite guy is Romeo. He makes me smile no matter what kind of day I'm having. The manager Francisco is awesome as well as Mike,Amanda,and Keou. I do MISS the fresh raspberries lol",1,1
"Love to go to Jamba Juice!  They have great staff, that will remember just how you order yours, and treat you right.  I always feel healthy after juicing.  Love it!",1,1
"Love the team at this store.  Mobile app ordering ahead is great when you're on your way to work.  Get your veggies, fruit, vitamins and throw in your cafferine fix and you're ready for work!!",1,1
Love any Jamba but this one is always friendly and pleasant. Especially love the seasonal pumpkin smash. It's great that the store always has new options to try.,1,1
"This Jamba Juice location is much more cozy than all the other ones I've been to. Now that they've recently added free Wi-Fi to the venue, I could see myself coming here more often, especially with how many tables they have available for customers.  It seems like this location offers Happy hour specials, as well as hidden freebies such as a free size upgrade with a premium boost added (tip provided by Ramil B.).   I'm glad to see such an accommodating Jamba Juice. Most of them are set up for people to simply come and go.  P.S. - You have to ask the cashier for login info to use the free Wi-Fi.",1,1
Friendly and very helpful staff. This location is always clean and we'll kept. It's never really busy here so the service is very fast.,1,1
"Well the first time I went to Jamba juice was for someone who ask me to stop and get them a mango drink, so while there, I decided to  try a kale drink, that was a mistake.Now everytime I go out, I always request we make Jamba juice my first stop or my last stop. LOVE IT!!!",1,1
Been here twice in two weeks. Workers are friendly and fast and their Acai bowls are SLAMMIN'!!! They totally hook it up where the cover  to the plastic  bowl barely closes shut!,1,1
"I have been coming to Jamba Juice for years and always get the same thing: a power sized Orange-A-Peel and a apple cinnamon pretzel.  Starbucks & McDonalds cannot compete with Jamba (although Tropical Smoothie Cafe gives them a run for their money on price point).  The ingredients are fresh and the staff is very vocal and friendly.  The best part is how satisfied I feel after having a smoothie from here, not to full and yet full of energy!  I remember being sick one time and how good it felt to get the ""Cold-buster"" in a few days I was good as new! (Please seek a doctor for serious medical issues however ;) )",1,1
"I loved Jamba Juice In California, I love it in Vegas!  I always adapt my juice a bit to have a little more strawberry flavor.",1,1
"It has been some time since Jamba Juice came to Las Vegas. When you could only find them in California, there was nothing better than getting a smoothie and walking along the beach on a beautiful day. Now that they are here and springing up in more convenient locations, around town, we Las Vegans do not have to suffer the heat alone.  This location is bright and inviting. When you walk through the doors, you are greeted with the aromatic smell of citrus. The ceiling to floor windows creates a welcoming atmosphere and the employees only boosts this impression with their friendly demeanor.   I usually get the mango-a-go-go, mega mango, or the mango mantra depending on how strict I am with my  caloric intake for the day. If I just say screw it, I tend to get the matcha green tea blast. Today, I decided to deviate from my standard order and try one of their three new smoothies that contains three full servings of fruits and vegetables. I love the mixture of these two food groups because they balance each other out. Sometimes fruit juices can be too sweet and vegetable juice too bitter. I got the berry uproot and loved it. I will say that this drink is not for everyone. It is no V8 Splash, you definitely can taste the complex veggie juice. It contains carrots, beets, kale, spinach, broccoli, and lettuce. It was a delightfully refreshing compliment to the mangoes,blueberries, strawberries, and mixed berry juice.",1,1
Was in the need of something to drink & happened to drive by here and had to come in. I have not had Jamba since living on Kauai 6yrs ago so I was excited to try it again. I was very surprised to see that they had a pumpkin smoothie! Of course that's what I ordered. The service was nice and fast and soon I was enjoying a very yummy pumpkin smoothie. I had never had a pumpkin smoothie before and really enjoyed this one. Can't wait to go back.,1,1
They have the best staff at this Jamba Juice. I work right by and the guys that work there are so nice. My drink always tastes great and they are very clean as well. You can tell they all get along and like each other. The deserve there tips.,1,1
jamba juice totally rocks i am a big fan they have really good smoothies and bagels thier services is preaty cool and you can order a smoothie with fruit only without the sugar and crap in it!,1,1
What can I say .... I come here all the time..  The servers are all sweet.. They always make my drink right... & I love my jamba juice... :],1,1
"This is the best Jamba Juice location in the city!!!  Way before Jamba made it an official policy (or at least before the other stores started doing it) they would give you the extra instead of dumping it down the sink :)  If you've never had Jamba Juice it is a must-drink!  No syrup and ice here...real fruit, real frozen yogurt or sherbert, real fruit juice, and ice.  This isn't a drink it's a real smoothie not some slushy imitation...they will make it so you need a spoon if you ask!",1,1
"When to Cardamone's for the first time yesterday.  I had to break up with my old hairdresser because of a location change.  :(  My stylist was Casey, and she did a good job!  She took direction well, was pleasant to talk to, and did the massage your head thingy when she washed my hair (I LOVEEEE that!).  I made an appoint for my son and me to come back in 5 weeks, which is my typical.  I'll also probably treat myself to a pedicure soon, since Casey had great things to say about the pedicurist on staff.  :)",1,1
"I needed to find a new salon near my new home, and upon a coworkers fabulous haircut and recommendation, I made an appointment with Kacy. I've been a happy customer for the past year. In addition to the talent and skill Kacy has taming my thick wavy mop; free parking lot, available appointments, and a relaxed neighborhood atmosphere keep me coming back every 6 weeks.",1,1
"What a lovely afternoon I just had at Styles by Cardamone in Regent Square. I actually just stopped in, no appointment, in dire need of a facial, but the gal who does them was not in. No worries though, Jennifer, the manager was super sweet, friendly and apologetic. So, I decided on a spur of the moment manicure, which they were happy to do, even sans appointment. Alyssa is awesome: she takes her time and gives a phenomenal hand massage. The hand scrub left my hands smelling of delicious citrus- yum! While they don't have a huge assortment of OPI colors (im obsessed with the new Fall line!) what they do have is top quality (i.e not mixed or old and thinned out with acetone). A manicure is only 15 bones, which is a lot less than what I have paid for other salons in the 'burgh who were not even close to this quality. I am booking my facial immediately after I post this review.",1,1
"My regular, most amazing stylist had to cancel my appointment and I was getting ready to go on vacation. I urgently needed a color, cut and a pedicure. Annette squeezed me into her schedule and did a wonderful job! Ashley gave me an excellent pedicure! I highly recommend this salon.",1,1
"Kacy is my girl. She gives me great cuts almost every time, we have good laughs while she does my hair!",1,1
"My wife and I have been going to Annette at Styles by Cardamone for many years for haircuts.  Always a pleasant experience, reasonably priced, and excellent service.  She is a proprietor who really cares about the services her shop provides.",1,1
Alyssa never fails to give me exactly what I want. Always walk out feeling refreshed and updated best haircut I ever had,1,1
"I had a really great experience with Kacy who waxed my brows, painted my nails and cut my hair (12"" off!). She was super flexible and really personable! I will definitely be coming back and making her my hair stylist!",1,1
"Kacy changed my life. I'd been to nearly every salon in Pittsburgh and no one could get my color right. She nailed it in one shot. This salon is friendly, reasonably priced and I've always left with perfect color and cut.",1,1
I get my nails done here every now and then. Cherry is great with everything she does. I always leave happy! They moved the store to another spot in splendid china tower and looks pretty.   Pretty nails for decent price,1,1
"I count myself quite lucky to live just a hop-skip away from Harrison Park. In the year since I moved to Edinburgh, I've been fortunate enough to see the changing of the seasons take place in this lovely green space. From spotting nearby hills crested with snow, to the early spring buds and blossoms on the trees along the canal, to the numerous barbecues and people luxuriating in the summer sun. It's autumn once more, and the yellowing trees are truly a sight to see on a brisk autumn day.  Harrison Park may not be huge like the Meadows, but it makes up for it by being connected directly onto the Union Canal, where you can walk, cycle, or run your heart out along the water. There's two different sections, West and East, one of which is normally full of sportsy folks doing their thing, and the other full of children on the playground and the prettiest dogs you ever did see stretching their legs on the green. It's well-paved and well-manicured, and just has a bit more of that community feeling to it than the bustling Meadows does.  If you find yourself in the area on a nice day, Harrison Park is definitely worth a wander!",1,1
"Harrison Park is a great park. Its quite big and has a fenced in area where dogs are not allowed, very good for wee ones to wander about in without worrying they might step in something!  It also has a nice play area with swings, slides and other structures for children to climb about on and have fun with.   But for me what makes this park extra special is the canal behind it. It has ducks and swans in it and a really great canal tea/coffee boat! Really worth visiting this park.",1,1
"Great local park for soaking up some sunshine when it's out, although I don't use it nearly as much as I should, seeing as I'm only a block or so away.  In summer, it is frequented by many from families and couples to a few mates kicking a ball around. There are 2 areas of grass, along with a play area for children, pathways and plenty of trees for shade. It's well maintained and easily accessible via the Union canal.",1,1
"I lived on Harrison Park for a few years. Well when I say 'on', I mean that my bedroom's window was on the park.  It was great to live there, with the proximity of the canal, and barbecues and frisbee games with my flatmates on sunny days. I also loved the fact that the park would be covered with crocuses in the spring time, and other flowers in summer.   Also, Harrison Park is only 20 mins from Tollcross on foot, so if you've never been there, you have no excuse.  Great spot for photos too, with the barges on the canal and the nearby Polwarth church!",1,1
"What a lovely space!  It's peaceful and well maintained, plenty of space to play a wee game of frisbee providing you don't get too excited!  It's got a nice community feel and it's next to the canal.  For a green space in town, I do prefer this to the meadows as it doesn't feel so massive but still has space for everyone.  There were no problems with BBQs here either, but the bins on two occasions caught fire and was rescued using canal water!  Just a little common sense to ensure the BBQ is properly cooled down before you dump it.  Anyways  I like this space.  I just wished we visited it when we lived on Shandon Place - I'm now kicking myself!",1,1
"On the north bank of the Union Canal, stretching seval hundred metres from Shandon to Polwarth, Harrison Park is a gem. It has an aspirational quality for me as I'd love to move nearer, into a classic Edinburgh flat overlooking its green expanse up to the canal. All in good time, so for now I'll walk past on my way to work, or through on the diagonal on my way home from town after reaching it along the canal path. Dog walkers at all times of the year, student picnics and barbecues when the weather's right and a mix of runners, families and others as the mood takes them.  It may not have the carrying capacity of The Meadows, but nor does it have to support the swarms who descend on that stretch of over-used lawn. Princes Street Gardens may enjoy the patronage of thousands of tourists, but Harrison Park need not concern itself with such demands on its time. Harrison is a local park, for local folk, linked to the rest of the city by the canal on one flank and plenty of bus routes all around. It's in two halves, one fringed by spring flowers and replete with a full on kids' playground, the other a home to new benches and paths, and sports teams over the weekend.",1,1
"I live close to Harrison Park and I usually find myself wandering over here when the sun comes out as I have no back garden. It   It's a pretty community area, in the middle of a residential area, just off the canal but is quiet and peaceful and well maintained. It is a huge space - not on the same scale as The Meadows. This is probably why I like it as I find The Meadows huge but also pretty crowded on sunny days when I just want to sprawl out and have my own space. There are two large sections, separated by a path and some tree's and a kids play park.  The pack is used by runners, mum's with kids, sunbathers and dog walkers and it is easy enough to find your own little space with no one overlapping. Tree's around the side of the park provide shade on sunny days, but lots of open sunny spots.  Margiotta's is just along the road and perfect for picking up supplies on sunny days.  So Harrison Park, I salute you as my 'outdoor office' and saviour on sunny days :-)",1,1
"Eased my fear of crowds at concerts, I am not a big concert goer but we had tickets last week and I risked it. Turns out it was really nice, there is a patio to escape (if needed), restrooms are close and not much of a line, 3 different bar areas, and just a generally good vibe. I would absolutely go to another concert at this venue.",1,1
This is a restaurant and entertainment venue. They are known for their fried chicken so of course I tried it. I am not really a lover of fried chicken but I thought theirs was pretty tasty. The batter was a little salty for me but it fries up nice and crispy and they recommend a honey sauce that mutes the saltiness a bit. I also got the side orders of mashed potatoes and the collard greens which were good as well.  They have bowling lanes both downstairs and upstairs and a stage for performances each night. From what I gathered some performances are free and others have an added charge.,1,1
"Items Selected: The Classic - Tomato, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil The Theresa - Butternut Squash, Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Basket of Smoked BBQ Wings Fried Chicken Platter - 8 Mixed Mac & Cheese - Baked with Bread Crumbs Veggie Buster - Roasted Butternut Squash, Mushrooms, Red Peppers, Artichokes, Eggplant, Olive, Arugula, Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Vinaigrette Bourbon Street Shake with Nutella and Bourbon Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream and Hot Fudge Chocolate Frosted Cupcakes  Knowing full well that testing a restaurant during its early days is always a risky proposition the visit from three friends, all music fans and two vegetarians, made Brooklyn Bowl an irresistible destination for Saturday Night; a night not without mistakes - but not a single one of them involving the food.  Over 80,000 square feet and opening nearly 20 minutes late as staff scrambled and soundcheck overran it must be said that the new Linq locale is beautiful, the dining area, stage, and lanes all up a gleaming escalator and with clever bowling-hip décor used to divide but not occlude each area from the next both the energy and the volume were high, even with the lanes not opened for ""unexpected"" reasons.  Settling into our seats, five of us in total, and provided the Blue Ribbon crafted menu service was decidedly rough around the edges - dishes misdescribed, crib notes clearly used, tickets incorrect, and delays plus dropped plates common - but with grace and humor plus a good environment most was forgivable...at least for now.  Moving on to food and beverage, a total of four beers and two milkshakes complimented six plates plus two desserts and with the Bourbon Street Shake and Cookie Dough disguised as French Toast ""bread pudding"" shining brightly amongst the sweets it was the savories that all wowed; 'bar' or 'bowling-alley' food only in spirit.  Beginning first with toasty pizzas featuring immaculate produce over thick toasted bread and moving on to smoked chicken wings so moist as to fall off the bone without a hint of grease it was what followed that most diners will come for, and with good reason.  Considered by some to be the ""best"" fried chicken they've ever tasted an 8 piece mixed plate was ordered and delivered alongside breadcrumb crusted macaroni that could certainly generate similar praise the matzo-crusted, brined bird truly was remarkable - just enough spice and salinity in the golden coat plus a chicharone-esque crunch to each bite bringing the quality of the moist bird to the fore. Already running an impressive kitchen in a venue primed to make a big impact in the local music scene it should only be assumed that service and timing will improve and while the 'best' debates will surely continue I know for a fact this was not my last visit to Brooklyn Bowl - gutter-balls and Black Label Society followed by a Banana Split and Molten Chocolate Brownie anyone?",1,1
"I really like how spacious the place is, and free water! And it's so close to the Linq and the roller! Also it's pretty cool how it has concerts and has a bowling alley!",1,1
"First time eating at the Brooklyn Bowl with my family. We went during the daytime after getting off the High Roller. I've been wanting to go to this place so I had very high expectations. To make a long story short, BB lived up to the hype. Great ambience, great food and great staff. They made a mistake with my son's meal and quickly fixed it. We enjoyed everything we ordered. I had the fried chicken and although it is not  your greasy flavored filled fried chicken, it was very good. I can't wait to come here again.  My only complaint is that most of their tables are hightops, which are not kid friendly. Other than that BB gets two thumbs up.",1,1
This is the prime spot for concerts for locals. They have the best bands and a variety like no other venue in town. Free valet parking under the high roller. Happy hour specials from 5pm-7pm. You can even purchase a lane for bowling during a concert for a low food and beverage minimum. Best seat in the house.  And the only place to get gluten free fried chicken in town!!  Check it out!,1,1
"During a recent trip to Vegas I ended up visiting BB a couple of times. The first time we stopped in it was just after 6pm. The place was pretty empty which made me a little nervous but we decided to stick around. We sat in the restaurant area near one of the bars.   I ordered the cajun catfish with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The catfish was blackened with minimal cajun spices. It wasn't really spicy but it was decent. It's always a gamble when ordering seafood at restaurants that aren't known for their fresh fish but I was happy with my entree. The fish was fresh and most importantly they didn't burn it. The mashed potatoes and greens were excellent as well. The food definitely wasn't typical ""bar food."" It was much better than I expected. My sister ordered the pulled pork. She enjoyed her food as well. We both ordered the rum punch to drink. That was excellent as well.   The service was great... the staff was really friendly. Our waitress even let me charge my phone at the bar. While we were there we found out that they were going to have live music later that evening so we decided to return after 9pm.  We ended up seeking this band from France called Caravan Palace. The place wasn't filled to capacity but it was a good size crowd. We ended up near the front of the stage off the the side with a near perfect view. We had a few drinks and just enjoyed the music. It was nice and relaxing. We enjoyed it so much that we ended up going back to BB to catch the Prince tribute they had a few days later.   The place doesn't seem to do as much business as one would expect and that's a shame. It's a really spacious venue perfect for parties or a simple night out on the town. Check out their show schedule and do yourself a favor by stopping in.",1,1
"This place is really cool.  I actually didn't know what it was and has passed it several times before.  It is a really large concert venue and bowling alley with a patio area which was cool for smokers.  I didn't get any food or drinks, but drink are drinks.  They have a live band and a lot of people dancing and having a good time.  Cool decor and atmosphere.",1,1
"This place has FANTASTIC FOOD! Their flatbreads are enough to feed two and are just to die for. When we entered the restaurant, service was great. The hostess was very welcoming, asked if we wanted to see the menu and that sat us right away.   The service was a tad bit slow when it came to our server. That is why I'm going to give it 4 stars. I know it's a new establishment so i'm almost confident they will fix their issues here and there. He did apologize and was SO KIND. We were very happy with his service. It is also a little tight and a little loud in there, so nothing romantic or intimate in this restaurant!",1,1
"I've been to Brooklyn Bowl on several occasions, and I must say, it's a cool joint! When I first heard about it, I wasn't sure how they would fit dining, bowling, and a music venue all in one, but they do it so well! I had the amazing privilege to see Bonobo there live a few months back. Hands down one of the best shows ever! Drink prices weren't too terrible. They even have cider which is a fave of mine. I've tried their fried chicken and their french bread pizzas and they both do not disappoint. If you're looking for a good spot to enjoy good food, entertainment and all around good vibes, you definitely need to make your way to Brooklyn Bowl.",1,1
Brooklyn Bowl is a great venue for concerts !! Second time here to see Blue October and the system is great with awesome lighting and you could see them from everywhere !! Little pricey on the drinks !! We have eaten here a couple times but really enjoy the concert venue!!,1,1
"We had a great time and amazing food here while in Vegas. There is a gluten-free memeber in our group.  Finding items for her to eat can be difficult.  We saw gluten-free fried chicken for her and it was wonderful.   My husband ordered a hamburger that he enjoyed. I loved their wedge salid, yum.. The staff was very attentive and friendly.   Great job all!",1,1
"Venue, bar, and fried chicken. Nothing else to really say. Wait, Yelp is saying this review is too short. There's also bowling here in this great non-vegas atmosphere.",1,1
"Went to see Cake on our anniversary. It's a pretty nice venue, not my favorite in town but nice none the less.  Park at The Linq parking lot, it's a short walk away to The BB and  lots of shops and restaurants. We didn't eat or bowl while inside but we did drink, nice selection of booze but the prices are steep. Our concert tickets were a bit pricey too, compared to other shows we've been to in town. The sound was good, no complaints, it wasn't over crowded, even on the floor. I think the floor is a bit small but it's nice to be able to actually see who is singing. There are only a few tables with chairs, so expect to stand. The floor is flat, so you will have an obstructed view if you are short.  It's a cool place, lots of great shows are scheduled. I will definitely go back!",1,1
"I had the chance to experience a night out at the original ""Brooklyn Bowl"", the one actually in Brooklyn two years ago and I was blown away by the place. So, on this trip to Vegas, when I learned that they had recently opened one here, I couldn't pass the chance to try it!  It was a great idea! I think they did a wonderful job in capturing the spirit of the original. Same kind of industrial look, same concept of open spaces with bars, restaurant and bowling alleys all open to a stage area where great bans appears nightly. The owners have such great skill at finding great bands that I don't even need to know who is going to play, I know it's going to be good and I will have a great night!  I sat at the restaurant just before the set and had a great table from where I can see the band. The food was good and tasty, the wine choice was a great match and the band was great.  After dinner, I continue to wander a bit around the see the place and enjoy the band and then realized that there is a second floor! Yes, the place is much bigger than the original one with a full  second floor (often labeled as VIP or reserved for private event). The second floor have a large opening over the part where the band is playing but have another full set of bowling lanes, a bar area and a private lounge.  The location is prime in Las Vegas just next to the Flamingo and across from the Mirage. It is located in a strip of shops called the ""Linq"" so you can't miss it, just head towards the largest ""observation wheel"" you ever saw!",1,1
Great place to watch a concert. We rented a lane which allowed 8 people and had a food and beverage. Had an awesome time!!! Staff was awesome!!! We definitely recommend!!!,1,1
"This is a really interesting venue.  You can bowl, eat some pretty good food, drink cocktails and hear a live band all at the same time.  Tonight's headliner was Milky Chance. The floor space is always GA with no seating.  It's standing only.   There are carnival posters on the exposed brick walls and the lighting is dim and funky.  It's a big place. There was a Tarot card reader there tonight but she announced she was leaving at 8:30pm sharp.  Guess it wasn't in the cards?   The food offerings consisted of 3 different types of chicken wings, 3 different types of sliders, French bread pizzas, Voss water, salads, couscous etc. I'd give the food three stars. An extra star for the intriguing space.  You can also purchase tickets nearby for the High Roller Ferris wheel.   Adults tickets are $24!  The ride takes 45 minutes and each car seats 12 people.",1,1
"While this place has both a bowling alley and a restaurant, this review is in regard to it as a concert venue. There is a lot to like, but there are some highly annoying issues that really take away from the experience of this place. Taking everything together, I really think the appropriate rating would be 3.5 stars, but I decided to round up given the potential of the venue.  As a birthday gift for my girlfriend, I bought tickets for an Erykah Badu concert at Brooklyn Bowl. Hoping to make the evening special, I purchased VIP tickets for us. I would expect that the VIP experience would begin at the entrance but instead we encountered a long wait in the will call line. Then, after finally getting our wristbands, we received no guidance to the VIP area. After asking about this and getting some vague directions from a staff member, we made our way upstairs to enter what we thought was the VIP area only to be informed that our VIP status didn't enable us entry to that particular area.  To help others avoid the same confusion, here's a description of what the VIP package actually entails at Brooklyn Bowl. Firstly, this information should have been clearly described on the Ticketfly ticketing site and the Brooklyn Bowl site as well, but sadly it was not. For clarification, there are downstairs and upstairs bowling alleys (with seating and standing room) to the left side of the stage and general admission concert area. The downstairs alley was closed for bowling and was the designated VIP area. VIP ticket holders could also access the upstairs bar, lounge, terrace and bathrooms. (TIP: use the upstairs bar as it is faster than the VIP bar downstairs.) The upstairs bowling alley area as well as the seating areas around the upstairs balcony (overlooking the GA area and stage) required additional admission privileges. VIP ticket holders could occupy the standing area upstairs behind the seating area, but the stage wasn't really visible when there were people standing in the seating area.  The downstairs VIP area is actually quite spacious with plenty of tables to place your drink. The tables are designed to look like audio road storage cases, which I thought was a nice touch. There are several couches too, but as the amount of VIP ticket holders outstripped the seating capacity by a lot, sitting was not an option. This wasn't really an issue though. Note that the side view of the stage from the VIP area is actually quite good and we were able to secure a spot fairly close to the stage. Moreover, we could float around and checkout the upstairs lounge without fear of not having a good view when we returned. The concert was also projected on all the large screens hanging over the bowling lanes, so, again, the view was amazing.  In general I really liked the venue. It's new and has a very modern, clean design. In addition to VIP amenities, there were also multiple bars in the GA concert area. Speaking of, it was a welcome surprise to finally find a bar that could actually make an Old Fashioned. It was far from being great, but a mediocre one is better than none. Plus, they could even make a Dark 'N Stormy! (Maybe I'm spoiled from life in the Bay Area, but I have had so many failed attempts at ordering this drink on recent trips to Reno and Vegas. Since when is jagermeister an ingredient?) That said, the bartenders were a little loose with the ice; I thought we were facing a drought. Also, there was some suspicious variable pricing: we ordered the same pair of drinks a second time and the price went up by $6! All complaints aside, though, I really did enjoy my evening watching Erykah Badu in concert. The DJ even continued to play some good music for dancing after the crowds had dispersed from the main floor.  I'll end this review with a few recommended improvements for the venue. * Provide clarity about what the VIP package includes. There was suspiciously lacking information on both the venue and ticket seller sites. * Include mobile ticketing options to speed up entry to the venue. * The VIP experience should start at the entrance: at the very least, give some guidance to where the VIP area is located.",1,1
"We walked in this place on a Saturday night around midnight and it was dead... I wondered why because it looked like a REALLY cool place, especially to see a show! They had some great bands coming up on the calendar too!   This retro, Coney Island, carnival themed venue was super cool. A unique place complete with 32 lanes of bowling! Come see a show while you knock down a few pins! The stage and floor were huge. General admission is SRO! Definitely enough room to get down though! The vintage carnival banners hung on the walls were awesome and fun to check out too.  All ages, everyday until 8 pm, so the kiddos can check out this amazing place also. I heard they have outstanding food too as they partnered with Blue Ribbon to create the menu! But alas, it was pretty late when we decided to check this place out, so we didn't get to try any.  I really liked this place. Located at ""The Linq"" - Parking was abundant. We'll have to plan a trip back to Vegas and check out a show here for sure!",1,1
"I love Brooklyn bowl, it is like a bar, game room, concert venue and bowling alley. I love the decor ion entry, but if you don't pay attention you can walk right by it. I made the mistake of thinking that it is inside the Linq, but it is within the Linq shopping area surrounding the casino and the high rollers.   I love that they have huge tv screens at the end of each lane, and comfortable sitting chairs to sit in and wait for your turn. We ordered blue ribbon small chicken bites and they were seasoned to perfection. We also ordered yummy potato tots, French fries, beer.   Our server was amazing and very attentive our entire visit here. Lucky we came on a night were they had a live band performing, so we enjoyed the show while bowling.",1,1
"Couldn't help not to stumble into their bright theatre-style lights on our way to the High Rollers, so afterwards, had the craving for a sweet tooth, and surprisingly, that Cupcake/Ice cream place closed by midnite, c'mon it's Vegas lol.  But glad it did b/c decided to check out the dessert menu, looked promising with the chocolate chip bread pudding or banana split but server gave the slight edge to the former.    Not just deleesh bc of the sweetness, which really didn't look that bad, just chocolate sauce, but the texture of the bread pudding was just right; a light crunch, amazingly not too soggy given how the vanilla ice cream melted right away.  Recommend for sure.  Overall, it's a nicer higher-end casual place, esp. for a bowling joint; also a good place to have some drinks too.  Like the grand entrance up the escalators, high ceilings and really, an overabundance of workers, must've dealt with about 6 different staff by the time it was said and done lol.",1,1
"Fantastic new venue at the Linq.   The staff is friendly, attentive and make sure you are happy.  The bowling is awesome. They bring you your shoes and Ball. Couches to relax and a server brings you your drinks.  Plenty of seating thruout the venue. The concert area is big and well thought out.  Looking forward to returning.  You guys Rock",1,1
"Came here for a few beers and sat at a cute little girls table named Alexandria. Great Service, Great atmosphere! Def coming back to bowl next time",1,1
"RockNRoll + Fried Chicken + Bowling  Great place for a night out with friends/family.  The food is great!  Make sure to try the fried chicken... That's what they're known for after all.    The restaurant and bar is good.  Most of the servers are there to make money, so they're always hustlin to take drink and/or food orders.  But make sure you speak up because the music is quite loud at times.    A big plus for the clean and well kept restrooms.  When you think of restroom and rock'n roll, you would think of rat infested run down stalls with graffiti and crap stains on the wall... but not here.    Side note:  It will be a pricey evening if you decide to come to Brooklyn Bowl... but who cares when you're having fun, right?   Regardless, have fun and be merry!",1,1
Awesome venue. A little small if I'm being honest for concerts where there's definitely going to be a big turn out but still a great spot. They have everything here and the atmosphere is great. Loved it. Saw the used here last night and it was amazing.,1,1
"If you like fried chicken and fries this is definitely the place to go!  It has a sports bar vibe and the main attraction besides the fried chicken is the bowling alley.  I love the upbeat vibe and it's a nice alternative to a bar where you have to fight for seats, and a definite upgrade from a classic american restaurant such as Applebee's.    It is within minutes of the High Roller, so if you're in the area definitely check it out! Plenty of parking at the lot as well.",1,1
"Went here opening weekend. What an amazing time we had. Live music, bowling, and great food and drinks. The decor is cool, the space is huge, and the staff was friendly and very attentive. Our server in the lanes, Tina, did a great job making sure our drinks were never empty and was on her A-game when it came to getting our very (extremely) complicated order right.   Great energy, great experience, and certainly a place I plan on frequenting in the future.   Perfect new weekend spot that everyone should check out.",1,1
"Great location and venue, we saw a live band there, staff is very very nice, attentive and helpful. Next time I will try their food as well.",1,1
"Really great place for a concert. The sound is always superb no matter the music and I like the general admission layout. You can upgrade to get a lane and bowl during events, an option I haven't tried yet but I would like to do so. They get you in fairly quickly and once you have a wrist band you can come in and out of the concert/bowling area very easily. There are two bar areas, one much larger than the other but the staff gets you your drinks pretty quick. I have yet to dine here but definitely another reason to come back soon. Just another great addition to the Linq!!",1,1
Best place to watch a concert in Vegas... by far! Food and customer service was exceptional!,1,1
"This venue is legit! Seriously! I love it! The fact that there is a bowling venue that offers amazing ""non bar food"" and bands : concerts love is huge for me! I have staff that deserves staff outings and incentives and this is the place to take them! Although it's a little spendy it is a fun time! Not the under 18 family venue you might want, but definitely a fun one!!",1,1
"Been to 3 concerts here and once just to hang out at the bar, but I still haven't been bowling here yet. I'd have to say that my experiences here have depended on the crowd of the band playing. If it's a large crowd, the entire concert area is packed and it's pretty hard to see anything. If you get there early enough, you can get a pretty good spot to see the stage. the drinks are relatively standard here and priced similar to other bars on the strip. Also we had the chicken n tots, which were pretty good. They usually have a VIP section on the side or on the balcony if you want to pay more for space and service. Otherwise, it's a great place to hang out and have a good time.",1,1
"We saw Phantogram tonight. This was my second time at Brooklyn Bowl, and my first legit show there.   Pros: Plenty of diverse standing room. If you are a shorty, you may actually get to see the drummer. The lighting was great. It was similar to the tribute show I saw before. It was perfect for the small-ish venue. It made the show feel at once more intimate and exciting.   Cons: The sound was iffy. The bass was solid, but at times was allowed to overwhelm the already effects laden vocals.   There are two bars, which is good news for thirsty folks. The lanes are adorable. I believe you can rent one for the night for around $400? But don't quote me on that.",1,1
"If you're ever around the Linq, or in Vegas, you must have their Fried Chicken. It is so good. My in-laws were in town from Louisiana,  and my mother in law could not believe how good the Fried Chicken is. She said that she would fly to Vegas just to have the fried chicken.  We also had the hummus and it is so tasty.  She loves hummus, and described it as being made just right and smooth.  I've been here a few times and every time I've been there, anything ordered has been so good. You can't go wrong with anything you order",1,1
Came here for a corporate event in which the sponsored company rented out the entire facility; so I have a little bit different viewpoint of the establishment.  These guys get great named musical acts and have very good food and tons of atmosphere!  Plenty of bars where you are not waiting too terribly long to be served.  All of the employees seemed very nice.  Definitely plan to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.,1,1
"This is the second time I have been here.  This time i took my kids with me.   It was happy hour when we arrived. All drinks and appetizers are at 50% off. The pitcher of prozen margarita came out to $20, cool!  We ordered their famous fried chicken (12 pcs of dark meat) which came with bread and honey. I also ordered the roasted adobo corn which is super delish!   Their staff is very friendly and attentive.  When you are in Vegas make sure to pass by this place and eat here. You won't regret it.",1,1
Ordered rings from here that needed to be sized. Turn around time is typically 3 weeks but they had them back in less than 2. Awesome because we had them in time for our photo shoot. Props to you jewelry section at Walmart!,1,1
"All 5 stars go to Jason in the firearms department, and Sue the assistant manager. They were both a delight to be around, and Jason kept us entertained throughout the firearm purchasing process. This store is also very clean!! This might be the only Walmart I can bear to go to.",1,1
"I had to get a new tire for my car and had three kids waiting along with me. The auto repair guys called me twice, first to inform me that the tire was not fixable. The next time was 20 minutes later to inform me that my car was done. Thanks. It's so hard to wait with hungry kids for anything really. Knowing my wait time exceeded our eating time was great!",1,1
The new pharmacy manager is EXCELLENT!  She has her team in line and gets stuff done quick!  Even though the pharmacy is busy.....we get our prescriptions quick and she is ALWAYS SMILING!  I will tell all of my friends to transfer to Walmart Pharmacy on Baseline & Greenfield!!,1,1
"I just want to give a big shout out to the lady that works in the garden center, she was so patient and very understanding! she was absolutely amazing we need more of her in this world so thank you Walmart I absolutely love this store and will continue to come back! You guys have amazing customer service always",1,1
"On my way to a recent doctor's appointment I decided to stop by this Starbucks location for a morning espresso. The reviews were pretty dismal, so I wasn't expecting much. It turned out, however, that my experience was pretty good. I may even come back if I'm in the area.   The parking situation is a little tough, with just one small lot that the entire plaza shares. I was lucky enough to get in early enough before the morning rush came in. The seating inside is full of character and the interior layout is unique. I found that to be nice, despite the small size.   As far as the staff, they looked overwhelmingly busy. The drive thru was slammed and they were also trying to stock the shelves as well. My service wasn't bad by any means, I adjusted my expectations before entering. And my drink was correct, which is most important.   In the end, this location is likely too small for the neighborhood it serves. The seating may not be enough inside either. But outside of those problems, I found this to be a decent place.",1,1
"It's Starbucks.   At this particular location though, if the drive through is busy, just go inside... It'll be quicker, I promise.",1,1
"The map makes it difficult to tell, but this is almost certainly the main Starbucks at the Desert Ridge Mall.  As it happens there is also a Starbucks inside the Albertson's at one end of the mall and there are Starbucks beverages to be found inside the Barnes & Noble, but the proper Starbucks is easily found toward the movie theater end of the place.  That said, the place is fine.  It's small and slightly cramped, but if you go to that mall during the day when the crowds are small then it's a decent little spot.  Given that it's located in the food-court-like area of the outdoor mall, the seating possibilities are vast, even though the interior is a bit cramped.  The people were always nice, as usual.  A cold Starbucks bev on a hot Phoenix summer day was not a bad way to go.",1,1
"Most Starbuck are pretty much the same. All have the same menu for the most part. The difference between them rely on the location on the way the seating is set up.  Pros: Big parking lot, good use of space available without feeling crammed, 3 lounge chairs with counter for drinks. Unlimited use of wifi, right off the 101, outside seating  Cons: Expensive lunch ( if you plan on grabbing food, do it before), only two decent size table for workspace, Hard to see the location off Tatum ( this is probably more cuz of city/ complex rules with marking the building with a sign). The parking is hard to find. I got lucky finding the only spot right up front.   Overall: All Starbucks are pretty much the same, this location is conveniently off the freeway, however lack of multi use tables for laptop work is a slight bummer. So I give it a four stars. They did however have great customer service. They did a pour-over for my favorite blend Blonde Roast.",1,1
Very happy with my experience here. Ordered three drinks and had them all done accurately. Friendly employees.,1,1
"Recently renovated, very clean, and many places to sit inside. Very friendly, one lady took the initiative and patience to hear what I was looking for and offered suggestions. Followed by explaining if i didn't like it, they'd remake it. I'll be coming back!",1,1
"Aces!  No complaints good or bad.  Usually pretty busy inside like most Starbucks, as far as seating.",1,1
"THIS STARBUCKS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE ON TATUM NEAR WALGREENS!  I now will park, get out of my car and walk to get my morning coffee. The employees here are so nice and represent that typical Starbucks employee so much better. It is clean and they are quick! They don't mess up my order every other time either.  I also like to come here to sit outside and enjoy my coffee, lots of outdoor seating available here.",1,1
I'm a regular at this Starbucks.  What makes the difference is the employee's and the personalized attention you get coming in.  I come everyday and it is home.,1,1
"I love this location. The atmosphere here is a great way to start your day if you're not a morning person. A lot of people, high energy and quick service.",1,1
They always make a great white chocolate mocha but the drive thru can be a little slow.,1,1
Easy to find. Outside seats are available. This particular location gets super busy though and is not that big inside so prepare to wait in small tight spaces in line to order/get your order. The employees are nice and friendly but do work slow especially on busy days. The bathroom is clean but not that big.,1,1
Nice Starbucks location in the Desert Ridge Mall it is tiny but they do have La Boulange available.,1,1
I absolutely love this Starbucks location! I come here almost every morning. The drive through can be a little long at times but inside is never a long wait. The workers are so nice and outgoing! Love this place! Easy 5 stars!,1,1
"We regularly go to this Starbucks and the staff is great. But special recognition due today as they are one of the few Starbucks nearby open for Christmas- so they are swamped. Lots of nice people in holiday spirit but also the Scrooges - those with no patience, mumbling, grumbling, jumping the long lines with whole families by mobile ordering once in line and generally being pushy.  Guess they had coal in their stockings this morning.  But the Starbucks staff are dealing in a friendly way with all the chaos. May they all have fabulous surprises during the holiday.",1,1
Come here every morning and have never had a bad experience. Awesome baristas that have been there for a while and are anyways in a good mood. Great way to start the day!,1,1
"The most amazing people, the most amazing location.  I couldn't be happier to have a Starbucks like them!",1,1
"Favorite Starbucks ever!! Every worker is fast, friendly, and knows what they are doing!",1,1
"this is a great starbucks. I drive through at least 3 times a week always get great service. also a great place to sit and do homework, great people, great coffee :) near desert ridge!",1,1
"By far the BEST Starbucks I've ever been to. I've been everywhere and what made this one stand out is the staff, no name tags but we were here at 5:56pm on Saturday Oct 11, 2 guys and a girl. Funny, interactive and went above and beyond for my fiance who can be a Starbucks snob sometimes. Great crew!",1,1
"I have never had any problems at this particular location. Have gone a few times a week for about 2 years and they were always polite, fast and got my order correct.",1,1
Drive-thru is rather quick at 5:30am in the morning and the barista was quite cheery for such an early hour -- completely different experience that the inside for a past few visits.  Just goes to show that a good experienced barista can make all the difference in the world!  Will Drive-thru again soon!,1,1
"First, I would recommend knowing the right time(s) to come here. I've been here approximately once every week for about 5 months now, and I highly suggest coming during a weekday lunch. For those who do want the weekend brunch thing but do not want to endure the wait, call ahead and get takeout. I'd say sacrificing the dining experience in this regard is well worth the good food.  Now Mickie's is straight up no fuss breakfast food, and that is a philosophy that champions well. On a given day, I am by no means a ""fancy"" breakfast food person, so I welcome Mickie's philosophy with open arms. The essential Mickie's item that is a must try is of course their scrambler, which is a heaping omelette on top of a heaping pile of the most fluffy, buttermilk potatoes (yanks) you will ever eat. Oh, and it comes with a mountain of gravy and toast as well. The scrambler is definitely a multi-meal endeavor, and for $7-8, it is definitely worth the price. Pancakes are also a good choice, but keep in mind these aren't the traditional stack you would get at an i-Hop. These are gargantuan in diameter and are more dense than what you would normally expect. For $6, this is again a multi-meal endeavor. You can get tired of it quick though, so I personally recommend the more savory items.   Now there will be customers who see the food here as too generic and too simple, but keep in mind that it is not execute simple things easily, especially when it comes to food, so take these criticisms with a grain of salt, and realize that after all is said and done, Mickie's is one of the best places in town.",1,1
"Mickey's dairy barn has the best hangover brunch food.  It comes in huge portions and is so delicious, especially the scrambler.  They have a big menu with decent prices, the prices are especially good if you go for lunch and get a burger.  This place is always packed for brunch, especially on football game days.",1,1
"Hefty! Hefty! Hefty! Portions that is.  If you're looking for yummy, cheap food in massive quantities, look no further. Mickies is the place to be.  The pancakes are monstrous!! But they are truthfully delicious. In fact I've been engaging in a scandalous love affair with their chocolate chip pancakes...(and sometimes, though less often, their strawberry pancake)...for the past few months. The relationship is a tough one that's cost me normal blood sugar levels and more importantly, friendships. Eating off the plate of my dear comrades who had themselves ordered the pancake has ultimately led to bitter disputes that never end smoothly. Ah well, the contentment I extract from each forkful of syrup-drenched, melty-chocolate-chip-covered pancake makes up for all the troubles.   On a more savory note, the corned beef hash is also quite fantastic. Get it alongside 2 sunny up eggs and rye toast and badda-bing, badda-bomb, you've got one killer breakfast for yourself.   One of my other go-to orders is the steak and eggs with hash browns and onions. Wowza! Now I know I wasn't exactly around in the '50s or nothin, but talk about old school diner food done wayyyy right.    Basically, Mickies nails it all. Everything they serve up has got yum written all over it. Be here or be square.",1,1
"My husband and I decided to Mickies and took the other reviews here in account when we arrived. We went early on a weekday because it is very small and does get easily crowded, so this was a good time to come. We brought cash since credit cards are not accepted (also please note, the ATM next door at Hotel Red does not work very well, so don't rely on it). My husband ordered the griddle cakes, I ordered the banana nut pancakes, and we shared the yanks with cheddar cheese on top. Neither of us were able to finish our food (this is very very rare for my husband!!). We could only eat one pancake each because they are very dense and cover a full sized dinner plate. We also had coffee which is bottomless and nice and dark just the way I like it.  Our server was very friendly and visited our table often to make sure we were doing ok. It is important to keep in mind that this place is not glamorous by any means, but has a nice homey divey retro charm. The food is decent and very generously portioned which I appreciate. We actually ended up eating our left over pancakes for dinner with some sausage, so we literally lived off our breakfast for a day! Awesome. :D We will definitely be coming back and I would like to try something different each time. I saw on my way out that they also have coffee cake and cinnamon buns which sounds enticing.  If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere to eat comfort food with a few good friends on the cheap, this is a good place to check out.",1,1
"Went here on March 24 in the morning. Had the blueberry coffee cake, blue berry pancakes and a scramble with gravy. Portions are super big. Would definitely recommend going there. Best blueberry coffee cake with lots of blueberries",1,1
"Old school diner that is usually busy.  If you want a milkshake for breakfast, this is the place.  I've always had friendly and quick service.  Huge portion sizes to fill you up for most of the day.",1,1
"I'm from back east and this place was suggested by some locals. The scrambler was epic deliciousness. My kids had the chocolate chip pancake (HUGE) and scrambled eggs with ham. My picky eaters devoured that food. The portions were huge so we have enough for lunch. Also, milkshakes with breakfast. I officially feel like I'm on vacation! Next time I'm in Wisconsin, I'll be stopping here. The staff is amazing, atmosphere is awesome. We need a place like this in my hometown!",1,1
"Restaurants should be judged against what they're trying to do, not against Tavern on the Green in NYC no matter what restaurant it is.  This is a breakfast place in a college town.  It's a ton of food for very little money, and the perfect cure for a hangover.  If you're looking for haute cuisine, this ain't it.  The pancakes are overwhelming in size and portion, the scramblers are famous, and any meal there can feed two over-30 adults.  Great malts, great 50s diner atmosphere, and long lines on weekend mornings.  Enjoy.",1,1
Huge portions and cheap prices.  Cash only but an ATM is inside ... really?  The one star ding is for not accepting digital transactions.,1,1
"SO MUCH Delicious food. The portions are plentiful! Came for brunch on a Sunday, it was busy. The staff was great and service was fast. Definitely coming back before I leave town.",1,1
"Mickies is a Madison classic. There's a reason this place has a line outside of it any given weekend morning. Mickies is a nice classic dinner vibe in the middle of a city with a food culture that is sometimes too trendy and too pricy. It's the perfect place for a game day breakfast or to nurse your hangover after a fun night out. Mickies is a classic dinner with affordable food and huge portions. For example, their delicious milkshakes come in the metal mixing cup, so you really get the full serving! However, considering the amount of leftovers customers have to box up, I do wish Mickies offered to-go boxes that weren't made of styrofoam.",1,1
"This is one of my fiancee's and my favorite places in Madison. The only downside is that you have to pay cash. All the food we've gotten is great. I love the chili and cheese omelet, my fiancee loves the scramblers, and the pancakes are great. Also, you have to try the coffee shake with chocolate syrup added - seriously to die for.  The other thing to consider is the seating - if you come during the ""peak"" hours, expect a wait and be ready to pounce on any open seats. I like to come right about 1 - most people have cleared out by then.",1,1
Best bang for your buck!! We had a ginormous breakfast for 3 that was also delicious for under $20. You can't beat it.   I had the French toast which is 2 cinnamon rolls cut in half and dipped in egg-DELICIOUS!! My husband had the chili cheese omelet with yanks (home fries) and devoured the whole thing. Our son had the kids breakfast and loved every bite.  The decor and feeling of place is a delightful mix of a quaint soda shoppe mixed and your grandmas living room. The service was great and we will be back very soon!,1,1
"Went to this restaurant for breakfast sat- and the entire family enjoyed it!  Go early on a sat am or the line will be out the door! The milkshakes are wonderful- my daughter had a cherry flavored one that was great. As described the place is a dive but they have reasonably priced, and good breakfast food. I ordered the pancakes- which I enjoyed. Looking forward to my next visit!",1,1
yummmmmmy. This place is just delicious and the portions are freaking huge! I don't have much to say because all the other reviewers pretty much said what I have to say. You really just have to come and try this place for yourself. You won't be disappointed! Also... Their gravy is DELICIOUS.,1,1
"the best breakfast you will ever eat.  she gets pretty busy in there, but the scrambler will bring your concept of time, worries, and interal organs to slow stop.  wonderful.",1,1
"Warning: cash only; seat yourself Pros: large portions, reasonable price, nice waiters Cons: long wait, stressful seating process  Walking into Mickies Dairy Bar without knowing anything about it can be quite daunting. On a weekend morning, the place is packed. There is a small sign at the front that informs people to seat themselves, but it's a little stressful. Unless you were born with the ability to determine when people are going to leave a table, you may find yourself a little anxious to get a table.  Once seated though, that stress dissipates and is replaced by good, hearty food. The scramble is delicious. It's also quite large. My friend and I split a cinnamon roll, a milkshake, and the scramble, and we were perfectly satisfied with the amount of food. The cinnamon roll doesn't look that appealing, but it's tasty. The milkshake comes with an extra cup-full, so it's great to share (or imbibe alone). The scramble is amazing. It's the perfect hangover/comfort food option. Eggs, cheese, meat, potatoes, and whatever else you want mixed together and served on a giant plate.   My friend got their chocolate chip pancakes and was pretty disappointed in them. They weren't soft and moist, and without syrup, it was difficult to eat much of it.  This place is a staple of Madison, so I recommend trying it at least once. I would suggest coming here in small groups, as the seating is limited during the most popular hours. Also, don't forget to bring cash!",1,1
"By the time my son and I got here I'd already run 5 miles and was starving.  The omelet (size alone) was mind-blowing.  Their potatoes, which they called some weird name that is currently escaping me, were even better.  Coffee was good, hot, and magically refilled.  We sat at the bar, great for people-watching because you're up higher.    I'm not usually one to enjoy dessert after breakfast, but you really can't pass up their milkshakes.  Remember - everything in moderation, including moderation.",1,1
"Came here a few times for breakfast. It's a pretty good place to grab breakfast on a weekday morning. Apparently the wait is a whole nother story during the weekends, but since I don't live in the neighborhood, i've never experienced the weekend crowd. So far, everything has been tasty. The portions are huuuge! The only down side is they are cash only.",1,1
"Great place! From price to quality to quantity, Mickey's had it all. Whoever said you couldn't have something fast, cheap, and delicious was wrong.   Definitely recommend for breakfast or ""brunch"".",1,1
LOVE THIS PLACE. Such good food. Seating is crowded but the staff are incredibly friendly. Favorite place for breakfast. Would recommend it to anyone!,1,1
"I went here for breakfast/brunch in autumn of 08. It was very good! I loved my blueberry shake, it was super delicious. The breakfast food was satisfying, but wasn't knock your socks off insanely awesome or special. I'd definitely go here again, it's a very homey, comfort food kind of place. Try the shakes!",1,1
"Mickies Dairy Bar is not healthy, the portions are enormous, and you are given an incredible amount to choose from for breakfast. Mickies gets a four for all the Saturdays my family came here and grabbed a booth early in the morning. Chocolate shakes aren't the same when they aren't served in a huge tin cup and finally I am to the size where I can actually finish a scrambler. If you go to Mickies make sure you go when you've got plenty of time, because you are going to need it for all the food. There is often a wait also.",1,1
"If you love diner breakfasts, this place is a MUST. I'm gluten-free, so I can't enjoy the amazing looking coffee cakes and pancakes, but the scrambles and potatoes were plenty. The coffee is delicious. Great service. I didn't get to try a milkshake this trip, but it is on my ""to-do"" list for next time. We went early and on very cold weekdays, so never had a wait, but I can see where this place would get packed, but I would still wait for breakfast..so good!",1,1
"This place is like family, as is everything in Madison. A must stop on game day. (Football, Basketball, Hockey, etc..) The largest portions you have ever seen anywhere in the state. Also has one of the most fun atmospheres in the city. I have been going there from childhood.",1,1
"Good food, nice waitstaff, huge portions. Can anything bad be said about a restaurant that brings your coffee cake before yor meal. Nice and warm, and e seasonal strawberry rhubarb is to die for.",1,1
Great pancakes.  My wife and I shared an order and couldn't finish. So massive and delicious.,1,1
"If you don't go to Mickie's at least once a month, do you even live in Madison? I've been here so many times and it has never disappointed. It's great. You get really big portions for what's usually only a few bucks. Their waffles are amazing, but I have also been equally satisfied with their omelettes! My only complaint is that on Saturday/Sunday mornings, it gets super crowded and the staff isn't great at handling it. I know a buzzer system/a bigger place would take away from  a lot of the 'fifties' charm that I and so many other people love about it, but I think it would be worth it as well. Either way, if the wait is not too long for your taste then I definitely recommend it!",1,1
"I can't give it five stars because it's too small, and too long to wait a LOT of the time.  Forget homegames, don't show up on Saturday or Sunday mornings unless you want to wait.  I'm tellin you though, it's so much food for such a reasonable price that you feel it 24 hours later.  Not for the faint of heart, or soft of stomach.  Be prepared, be very prepared because you will spend the rest of your day curled up on the couch cursing your misfortune of having eaten all of the scrambler.  Also, they might have the best shakes in Madison (ice cream, not post stuffing yourself seizures).",1,1
Dr Matt is seriously the friendliest dentist EVER!  He makes it feel like your visiting an old family friend instead of the dentist. He was interesting in my wedding planning even offered to make my cake for me LOL! And he is good at what he does.,1,1
"Awesome dentist!  His office staff is super friendly and helpful.  Dee and Marci are the best.  I had a previous dentist that I was with for over 20 years and he retired, so was nervous to try someone new.  Well, Dr. Weaver was a million times better than my last dentist, so no more worry there.  OMG, he makes a going to the dentist, not really so bad at all!  He makes you feel at ease right away.  He has a great personality and jokes around, which makes your more relaxed.  He is very gentile, tells you what he is doing as he does it, and is very thorough and precise. Dr. Weaver is really as good as it gets, super dentist  :)",1,1
"Dr. Matt is the best!  He's friendly and professional, and most importantly a great dentist!  The office staff is pleasant as well.",1,1
Dr. Weaver is incredible at what he does.  I appreciate his care and the way that he remembers our family each time that we are there.  I would highly recommend Dr. Weaver to anyone looking for a new dentist.,1,1
"Luis has done several jobs for us at Del Sol Furniture and we are very happy with his work. He is fast, same day if you need it. He is knowledgeable and honest. We plan on using ASAP for all of our properties. Keep up the good work Luis!",1,1
"Thank you, Luis, for making our commercial heater work again!  All of the employees were all freezing until you came and repaired it for us :)  Very professional and upfront about costs.  We will definitely do business with Luis again!",1,1
"Prompt, efficient and honest technician. Luis explained the problem, pointed out at a couple of opportunities for preventive maintenance without pushing extra sales. Took the time to verify unit performed correctly in all modes. Very reasonable rates.",1,1
"I called ASAP and he showed up the next day. Very friendly and professional. We are on a budget so he gave me all the options.   Great service, I would recommend ASAP Pro Services and Luis to friends and family.",1,1
"I used Luis for a repair on a rental property, which went smoothly. I have since recommended him to several friends, they were as was I, quite pleased that he was a straight forward honest guy. My repair was done the same day I called, which kept my tenant happy;",1,1
They do great work at this shop.  Very dependable.  Ive been a customer for several years. They are honest and trustworthy. I have recommended them to all my close friends and family,1,1
We've taken both of our cars here for service. One they did a diagnostic and found it needed to go somewhere for the transmission. They didn't charge us and referred us to a place in Phoenix that did a good job and was very affordable. Our other car they did an extensive diagnostic on and gave it a tune up and some other things. The car had been out of commission for two years and they got it working really well and for a reasonable price. We'll definitely be going to them in the future. They were really nice and seem really honest.,1,1
"My whole family has always taken all of their cars here. Always get quality work, in a timely manner without being charged extreme amounts.   Quality honest people. Would highly recommend taking your cars here for your regular service and any other car needs.",1,1
"I needed a new shop last year and chose this one based on Yelp reviews. I have been more than pleased. The owner has gone above and beyond more than once which I appreciate more than I can say. The workmanship is good, the prices are fair, they are friendly and the shop is clean. I am grateful I found them and highly recommend this shop.",1,1
"Great place to take your vehicle. Always a great experience, quick and done right. Wouldn't go anywhere else",1,1
"I was lucky enough to inherit Virgil and his crew at Highland Auto in Chandler more than 15 years ago. Virgil is the best! He is fair and honest as the day is long. If it's more than an oil change, it goes to Virgil and Highland Auto. A recent example: My wife's car failed emission testing. ""Oh, great. There goes a $1,000."" Took the Highlander to Highland Auto on Friday evening. Virgil called me at 1 p.m. the next day.  From the emissions report I read, I thought we were really screwed. I'm no master mechanic, but I grew up on farm where equipment constantly broke and spent six years in the Canoe Club working on jet engines. I figured an EGR valve replacement at the very least.  Virgil: ""Yeah, it was a bad gas cap."" Any other mechanic could have taken me for a $500 ride. Virgil has integrity. And he's a great mechanic!",1,1
"I'm writing this on behalf of my girlfriend. She has been going to Highland Auto Repair for 11 years. She likes them because they are dependable, honest, knowledgeable and guarantee their work. If you are in a pinch, they can usually squeeze you in. They are trustworthy and don't take advantage of women by trying to sell them things they don't need or bogus repairs. The owner, Virgil, has owned this business for 25+ years and has always maintained a supreme degree of integrity.  This shop is ideal for people on the go, ladies that need honest mechanics and senior citizens on tight budgets.  My girlfriend gives this business a solid 5 stars!!!",1,1
"Took my GMC Yukon here to get my transmission flushed and have the filter replaced. It only cost me $120 vs. the dealerships that wanted to charge me $400. Additionally, the Yukon was veering slightly to the left, so I asked them to look at that while they were working on it. They weren't able to do the alignment there because of the 20"" rims, but they referred me to a place that did it for fairly cheap.   Downside: waiting room is tiny, and there's no wifi, which is annoying when you're waiting a couple hours.",1,1
Virgil is the best. He will only perform work that needs to be done. No excess charges and added on fees.,1,1
"My husband and I are so thankful we found Virgil and his shop. He is so honest, hardworking, and has the best prices on EVERYTHING. After BMW North Scottsdale told me there was something wrong with my oil tank and was going to cost me over $900 I took it to Virgil for a second opinion. He checked it out same day and called back saying absolutely nothing was wrong. I went that evening to pick it up and Jeremy didn't even charge me a penny. They are all so nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. To date they have worked on my BMW, my old Xterra, my husband's Xterra and we will continue to take any car of ours in the future to them. I would recommend them to ANYBODY looking for a reliable, trusted mechanic which has the best prices around to boot!",1,1
"I started taking my vehicles to this shop about 6 months ago. I can say without hesitation that this is the best auto repair shop in the East Valley, maybe the entire metro Phoenix area. They're neither cheap nor expensive, their prices are right where they should be considering a full-fledged shop with extremely knowledgable mechanics. They can pretty much fix just about anything. I have sat there watching them in action and listening to Virgil talking to customers and calling parts stores on a couple of occasions while waiting for my car to be repaired. They are not out to screw you, Virgil - the owner - is fair, reasonable and has a good head on his shoulder. He is also a very caring person. He's also very personable and has some rather amusing life stories.  I never saw a single person come in and start getting into anyone's face about ""bad repairs"" and if there is an issue, they are going to deal with it directly and immediately. I, like probably everyone else, have taken my vehicles to shops that were definitely out to screw you. Add this and that and make up charges for work that wasn't done or work that didn't need to be done. You are NOT going to find this kind of stuff going on at Highland Auto. If you are female, I can only say that this is the place to take your car if you don't want to be intimidated by high pressure shop managers who will try to convince you that you are going to die if you keep driving your vehicle the way it is.  I do not work there and am not related to anyone there, I am simply another very satisfied customer.",1,1
"Two thumbs way up for Virgil and his crew!  Nothing not to like here.  Finally a repair shop that understands you want your vehicle fixed, not re-built - part by part and bolt by bolt!  Our first meeting was when we had our ""Wonder Truck,"" all of us ""wondering"" how and why it kept moving.  It's been 10+ years and several cars later and we keep returning!  Great prices, excellent service, no up-sell!  If you need a mechanic you can trust, it doesn't get any better than Highland Auto!",1,1
"I have been to this place about 4 times and they identified the problem and fixed it.  The cost was affordable compared to other establishments.  They take no appointments.  You must continue to ask them the status of your vehicle to help them stay on top of the high # of cars that are being dropped off to be fixed by folks.  If you don't, you may be forgotten, especially if you cannot get a response on how long it will take.",1,1
"Virgil has been our go-to car guy for everything auto.  He does excellent work and you can be confident it's done correctly.  The best trait that Virgil has is his honesty.  Years ago we had one of those computerized analysis done on a car and it listed $1,100 worth of needed repairs.  We took it to Virgil and he told us we needed NONE of those repairs.  We've been going to him ever since.  He's the BEST!",1,1
"Cannot say enough good things about this auto repair shop!!! I know almost nothing about cars, so getting any kind of repairs is scary because I know I could easily get ripped off. That is not the case here! Virgil and his team are honest, hard-working, good people. I have brought two different used cars here over the last three years for repairs and Highland Auto has saved me thousands of dollars, no doubt about it.  The location is nothing fancy, but don't let that deter you. You're not there for free coffee and wifi, are you? No - you're there to fix your car for a reasonable price. I recommend dropping off your vehicle and waiting at home/work/anywhere else. The ""front desk"" service is sparse... It's not *bad* service, but not good - understandable because Highland Auto's staff is small and everyone is always busy fixing cars. They can offer affordable prices because they aren't wasting money on a secretary or fancy waiting area.   There have been instances where I've called to get an update on my car repairs, and nobody answers the phone. It can be frustrating when you're waiting to get your car back, but I'd rather deal with sparse service than a shady/dishonest repair shop. If you get a quote from another auto repair place, bring the paperwork here and let Virgil take a look. Many times he advised me that I don't need to do the repairs recommended by the dealer (where I take my car to get oil changes); he is honest about what work is critical and what is just cosmetic. If you have an older used car, it doesn't always make sense to do certain repairs. It is a relief having Virgil on your side to guide you through the confusing world of car repairs. Virgil always beats prices from other repair shops, so it literally pays to get a second opinion. Plus, he will do an evaluation for free!  I won't waste my time with any other auto repair shop in Phoenix. Virgil is simply the best at what he does - providing quality, affordable car repairs. You can rest assured that you are not being scammed or ripped off here!",1,1
"Virgil, the owner, and his crew are amazing. We take our cars there for any repairs even though it is not the closes auto place to us. Today Vergil fixed something for me that others wanted to charge at least $90 for. He is honest and trustworthy. You will not find anyone else that can beat the service and or his prices. This is the place to go.",1,1
Virgil is wonderful and you cannot beat their prices!  They were half the price of another place for replacing valve cover gaskets and spark plugs and one third the price of the first place I received an estimate.  It was the difference between paying 1k and $376!,1,1
"Great place to get your service done, HONEST, reliable, and reasonably priced.  As a female and a senior, it is great to know I will not be taken advantage of and told I need something extra done.  I have upmost trust and confidence in Virgil and his staff.  I have been using them for several years.",1,1
"Honest, reasonable and well informed, very fairly priced and excellent workmanship.  The last time I was in the owner said to me with complete sincerity, ""If you have any problems or questions about my work on your car, please call me right away.""  He obviously didn't actually DO the work on the the truck, but he OWNED it and I know I won't have to call him.  But I sure will, the next time I need a mechanic!  The shop, as you would expect, is immaculate and every vehicle left there is secured at all times.",1,1
"This was my second time bringing my corolla in. I'm so happy! They really know what they are doing, and were cheaper than anywhere else! I can tell they are busy, but I can still show up and then can do maintenance the same day. Seriously, half the price of what I was quoted elsewhere.",1,1
The mechanics here not only do an amazing job but they are truly the most honest mechanics around.  They never try and fix something that's not needed.  Before they actually repair my car they always call with a price beforehand.  I will never take my car to anyone else.,1,1
"Virgil and his team are awesome. They do great work at reasonable prices.  I have been going to him for five years with all our vehicles. I recommend this auto mechanic to all my friends. Previously, the mechanics I went to wanted to ""gold-plate"" my truck and fix everything under the sun for top prices, or when I had a transmission done for a good price at another shop it leaked afterward! Highland Auto has told me I didnt need to replace certain things and has been very honest. - Jon H. in Chandler.",1,1
The Owner is great. He is a trustworthy mechanic and does a great job with all of my cars.,1,1
"Virgil and company are the absolute BEST, BAR NONE for any auto repair/standard maintenance jobs you may have! I've been using Highland Auto exclusively since moving to the area 6 years ago after a recommendation from a co-worker. These guys are reliable, honest and stand behind their work! I can't state effectively enough how much I appreciate Virgil and his crew! Next time you're in the market for an honest auto repair at reasonable prices, do yourself a favor and go to Highland Auto!",1,1
"There is something about this place that just puts customers at ease, and that is really rare with auto body shops these days. I've had work done twice by Highland and I will continue to use them for all future auto repairs. Never once have I felt like I was being intimidated, pressured, or ripped off. In fact, this place seems to pride itself on listening to what your concerns and needs are and offering you an honest assessment of your vehicle. The employees that work here are down to earth people. They don't try to beat around the bush and sell you anything. The guys I have dealt with there are men of little words, which actually threw me off a bit. I was expecting to hear a sales pitch, but instead I just got the truth. If you go in for brake work, then they look at your brakes. They don't try to sell you anything else. Don't expect to receive huge discounts, but their pricing is competitive and fair and the quality of work performed is top notch. As a car owner, you can't ask for anything more.",1,1
Highland Auto is by far the BEST! If there was an option to give more stars I would.  I trust them 110% I refer everyone to Highland. The owner is so nice! They are honest and amazing at their repair work. I can always rely on them and never worry if they are doing a botched job. You will sometimes have to call to get an update but that's just because they are hard working and not sitting at the desk.,1,1
Super awesome car wash. Get the $15 package and you can come back in 4 days and get it washed again. Free vacuum after the wash. Legit!! It's a 20 min drive for me but worth it in my opinion. The vacuums have a very strong suction which I find most car washes have very weak suction which is a deal breaker for me especially when I have 2 very active toddlers lol,1,1
"I love it here, it is the best wash.  All the employees are so friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend coming here.",1,1
The best car wash in Charlotte HANDS DOWN. It actually cleaned all the little corners around my license plate! The store manager Stan is friendly and made sure I had a great experience. Make sure to ask for the mat cleaning token for $2. Mats come out of the machine looking like new!!!! Also I recommend the hot wax. I have a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it always make the black paint and chrome pop!,1,1
"I love this car wash!  I really feel like I get superb service. The personal touch of someone at the screen to help guide you through your order, to spraying bug cleaner and using a brush and power washer to get off excess grime.   The actual service riding through is so much fun seeing the led colors and bubbles. It's like going through a Disney ride. I also like that when your vents in the car are on. It smells clean and fresh.   They have complementary coffee and hot chocolate inside, air for your tires, and vacuums outside.    What an incredible value and service!! I highly recommend them!!!",1,1
"I'm so happy that they opened a location on South Blvd. There are locations in Pineville, Matthews and University already in Charlotte. Here's how it works, there are four different kinds of washes you can choose from, all ranging from $5 to $15 (or you can get UNLIMITED car washes for $29.99 per month) and you can get extra add ons such as hot wax, tire shine or Mat Cleaner for $2-$3. So you pull up to the machine and choose what you want and then you pull through the car wash and you have people guiding you to pull through and adding some detail things like protecting my rearview windshield wiper.   Then you put your car on the track and it pulls you through. Imagine one of the car washes at a gas station but on STEROIDS! It had bright fun lights which I really enjoyed! It brought my car in nice and slow to get it completely covered in soap and there were brushes coming from all directions to get it really clean. Then your car gets dried off by a huge  touch-free dryer.   They have stations where you can pull up and vacuum your car for FREE and they have FREE coffee inside!",1,1
"Michel's been pretty consistent over the years.  I remember when they along with Cultures, Druxy's and Mmmmuffins were the main places to go for breads, croissants, muffins etc.  It's good to see that most of their locations are still around.  The leek and cheese croissant has been replaced but the cheese knot is still around and as fresh and yummy as ever.  Prices are reasonable depending on what you order,  Union Station location appears to have the best selection.",1,1
"This is a review of the hotel.   I don't know why people are talking poorly of this place.  You really do get what you pay for.  It's not the MGM or Mandalay Bay - it's Hooters.  The room I stayed in was on the Ocean View tower (it's Vegas - there are no ocean views - I guess they meant pool).  The room was spacious.  The beds were doubles, not queens, but still comfortable.  There was just a sheet and a thin quilt on the bed, so maybe more sheets would have made it better.   The room was not a mess at all, and it didn't seem like it was falling apart.  It looked older and could be renovated, but it was still nice.   All except maybe the air conditioner, but it worked just fine.   The only bad thing was the lifts in our tower were not working, so you'd have to hike it to the next tower.  A little bit of an inconvenience, but not too bad.  I guess I wasn't drunk enough.   I got a great deal on this place, so I'm not complaining.  Again, you get what you pay for.",1,1
"Ok - this place is what it is.  It's a hotel/casino version of the restaurant chain. It's low class, it trends just toward the wrong side of red neck (although if you're looking for your fill of mullets this is your place!) and it's a lot of fun. They don't try to pretend to be anything they're not. And that's what makes this place perfect.  The casino is tiny. The limits are very low. The dealers (generally) are a lot of fun. The cocktail waitresses are always on their game - I don't think I've ever gone more than 20 minutes in this place without being offered a(nother) drink. The rooms are cheap and clean - not overly comfortable, but when you're collapsing into bed at 4a (or later) who really cares?  When it's a boys trip to Vegas we always stay here. And even if we're staying somewhere else, chances are we're spending the bulk of our time here.",1,1
You get what you pay for. The front desk was nice and professional when I checked in. The room was average. Not the best but at $23 a night I can't complain. Only complaint was the construction noise that made it hard to sleep.,1,1
I give it 4 stars I love the slots here. Everyone is friendly & kind. The games/slots are fun. I been here a few times and it's so much fun I will return.,1,1
"Wings were HOT, HUGE AND FRESH!!! Food was amazing even at 2AM at night! We will come here again and we have recommended to a few others while there in Vegas.",1,1
Just stopped in on our way home. Great service and great burger! I had the western burger it was perfect in every way. And my beer was just as good.,1,1
"Loved it loved it loved it!  I know, Hooter's?  Who stays at Hooter's?  I did for a week and I fell in love with the place. First of all, there is a 24 hour pool. And most importantly, the people at the pool were not pretentious or snooty at all. I met some really cool people there that just wanted to have fun.  That doesn't happen in Vegas very often, so we took advantage of the 24hrs!  2nd, the hotel room rates are cheap during the week. 4 nights for 83 dollars! When I booked it, I was so scared that it would be a run down hotel and would be dirty.  I was wrong. It was clean and the hotel room was bright and cheery. 3rd, 25 cents buffalo wings from 12-6am!  Could you ask for anymore? 4th, they played great music at the pool.  I am not much of a gambler, in fact, I didn't gamble at all. But if you want a cool place to hang out, don't hesitate!",1,1
For the price you can't beat it.  I have stayed here for $20 before .   Last night haloween I paid $79 and tonight &  tomorrow $34 .   It a clean comfortable room for the price.    There is really no cute staff except the front desk and maybe 1 dealer but who cares hot girls are all over this town.   I have stayed in many hotels here and paid $200-300 per night and relize you are not in the room that much.    Save the $$.  And go see a show or hey come Back with the $$. You save,1,1
"Came here once for my birthday in 2013 for the weekend.  This place was awesome for how cheap it was and how close it was to the MGM Grand (Right across the street), I went to a concert and was able to just cross the street and BAM!, I'm back at my room.  The rooms aren't luxurious, but I was satisfied with everything there: The view, the pool, the food, the cheap black jack tables, the location, the cleanliness, the shower + bathroom, TV+Channels, Beds, easy parking, and the proximity to the strip.    I would come here again, and I would recommend this place for everyone who wants to save money and also have a great time.  I can't even really think of anything negative to say about the place.  I spilled a patron margarita at the pool, and a bartender replaced it for free with no hassle. I tipped her well though, cause of her awesomeness.   I've been to SEVERAL other Hotels on the strip, and this place has included my some of my favorite memories.  Not to say that I wouldn't prefer anywhere else, but this specific trip to Las Vegas was easily the most memorable.",1,1
"Bronze Cafe is a treat in the desert of Las Vegas. The food and service are spectacular. Healthy, friendly, lovely place. I went with my family of 7, and everyone was able to get what they wanted from bacon to vegan. I won big points with my family finding this gem. My only suggestion for improvement is to have real plates and eating utensils rather than paper and plastic.",1,1
"In Vegas & struggling to eat healthy? Yeaa, me too. Bronze Cafe is our answer. Here for a week on biz and enjoying my time eating here for lunch & dinner - everyday. Staff is cool, down to earth & friendly. Nutrition for mind, body, and soul. :)",1,1
"OK, I get what all the hype is about.  I really enjoyed my lunch, everyone was very friendly.  It is so nice to just have what seems like a healthy meal option that is well made and perfectly seasoned.  I will have to try some of the other options.",1,1
"I've been at meetings at The Center.  Great meeting place.  With The Bronze Cafe there, we can eat great food while in the meetings.  Friendly staff, tasty food and good prices.  If I worked closer, I would use this as a lunch place for myself and a place to meet clients at.",1,1
"I work pretty close to the center so I decided to finally grab a to-go lunch from Bronze Cafe. I ordered the Tree of Life Pita which was flavorful, fresh, clean, and satisfying. I have been thinking about it for two whole days. I can eat that everyday for lunch.   The employees seemed friendly and I thought it was extra cute how each time my name was called, the guy handling my order got closer and closer to the correct pronunciation. *highfive*",1,1
Love it here! Amazing vegetarian food and healthy delicious options :) great for both meat eaters & vegetarians,1,1
Absolutely amazing!!! We read the reviews and knew we had to try while visiting Las Vegas. The Complicated...bacon jam...that's all that needs to be said. Great sandwich. Also had the Tree of Life sandwich. Completely on the other side of healthy and delicious. The sandwiches are so big that you just need to commit and not put it down until your done!!! This will not be the only visit while in town.,1,1
What a treat to find somewhere to get my green smoothie fix! Super friendly and helpful staff. A welcome change of pace from the normal food offerings of vegas. I got the real results fitness smoothie and added kale it did not disappoint and tasted like a peanut butter cup! Yummy! I hope this isn't my last time at Bronze Cafe but good thing they deliver to my hotel.,1,1
Bronze café is one of my favorite places. The chicken salad goddess sandwhich is my favorite. the little salad on the side with the dressing is also good. the watermelon chia water is delicious. i sometimes only go there for the water.,1,1
"I could eat here every day...and right now I basically do. The ingredients are so fresh and flavorful, and even though I find myself drooling over some of the pastries (Poblano Cheddar Biscuit...YUM) and sandwiches, I find myself relying on a trusty favorite, The Bizness salad. You get a generous portion of kale dressed in a fresh lemon vinaigrette, topped with your choice of 3 sides. You can choose from curried chickpeas, sesame broccoli, beets, chopped avocado, roasted brussel sprouts, quinoa with almonds, etc. All are beyond delicious when tossed with the kale and stirred up together, and is perfectly filling. Even better if you ask for a side of pita, which comes stacked in a foil packet, steaming, warm, and soft.   The LGBTQ sandwich is another fave, with housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, greens, tomatoes, cucumber, and basil aoli on ciabatta, and you can add turkey and avocado to make it ""The Complicated Order"".   There are coffee, smoothies, tea drinks, etc. to enjoy in the lounge area in the entrance of the LGBTQ community center, and the staff is super friendly. I usually get my stuff to go and even without calling ahead, I never wait more than 5 minutes. I love, love, love the Bronze Cafe.",1,1
"A fabulous place with quality food and ingredients! I have tried just about everything here and my favorites are the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad(full size), the LGBTQ, and Good Earth. Everything is filled with flavor. I come here quite often because of the food and friendly service.",1,1
"Carnegie deli has nothing on them! And yes they have gluten-free bread for their amazing sandwiches, and they have amazing  salads that taste super fresh! Awesome coffee too!",1,1
"Amazing, amazing and amazing!!! the tree of life is DELICIOUS. Planning to go back and check out the rest of the menu. The service was great and the atmosphere chill. A bit tricky to find but more than worth it when I did.",1,1
I order the Tree of Life Pita and it was Ahhh-mazing! so fresh and flavorful. I already cant wait to go back and get again. I also got two of the vegan cookies that I cant wait to try.,1,1
"I love this place. I try and have something different every time I come. I have tried every vegetarian item on the menu, and they are all great.   It is very casual and there are people coming and going. The staff are super friendly and helpful.   Their vegan desserts are great too.",1,1
"This weekend my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to come across the Bronze Cafe!! As we stood trying to decide what to order, out came Howard. Howard was seemingly able to read our tastes immediately.  He recommended the pineapple mint chia drink for my hubby and I had the watermelon chia, BOTH ARE AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  I then ordered the tree of life sandwich that he suggested. It came with a side salad of mixed greens caressed in a delicious lemon vinaigrette!  The Bronze Cafe is my new desert oasis.Howard you are my new best friend!! Thank you for the great cafe experience.",1,1
"Coffee, service and sandwiches are all on point! *Bathrooms are gender neutral,*  this was my first experience with one, caught me a bit off guard but obviously they are perfectly fine and clean! WiFi is hit or miss until march when they update their system",1,1
"Can't rave about this place enough. After moving from the bay, I was really missing the fresh delicious food that seemed to abound in Berkeley. And then I found the bronze cafe and I was on cloud 9. I could eat the bizness with it's many combos everyday and the sandwiches are all delicious.  Even with the slightly high prices, this place is 5 stars hands down.",1,1
"This place had delicious, fresh, great quality ingredients and a variety of menu options for everyone. I am not a vegetarian or a vegan and I enjoy all this little gem has to offer.  Prices are a bit expensive for what you get, but expected since it's a small, local cafe. I also wish there were more breakfast options.   Overall, the food is delicious, the place is so clean, and they are pretty great about not making you wait forever food. The service is not just fast, but friendly and attentive, too.   Their dessert case is TO DIE FOR! You must try some of the ""cheesecakes,"" as well. Yum!!!",1,1
Found this randomly on here looking for healthy options while traveling. It's inside a community center but don't let that stop you... It's AMAZING! My friends and I all ordered something different and each one of us loved what we had. The salads in particular were fresh and delicious! Now found another Vegas favorite!,1,1
I've never eaten anywhere with a more consistent kitchen. The food is always prepared quickly and perfectly not to mention every item on the menu is delicious.  My only complaint is that the sandwiches are stacked too high but that really only makes me love them more.,1,1
"Awesome, wholesome food in a little cute cafe tucked away in the LGBT center, I wonder how many people would miss this place because they never step into this center!   Came here for lunch and everything was made to order. Although that is the case, service was very prompt and courteous, and the worker was able to answer any questions you would have. Tried the vegucated sandwich, which is the vegan version of a turkey bacon sandwich, with coconut bacon jam, avocado, tofurkey, vegan bacon, and lots of veggies, on a ciabatta--super delicious! It was very filling too, I actually just had a few sip of my soup and couldn't even manage more. Soup of the day was coconut curry, which was perfect for the rare rainy day we happened to be having that day.",1,1
"Very nice place.  My sandwich was excellent, it was a regular turkey sandwich with avocado, tomatoes, bla bla bla, but they put a very delicious lemon vinaigrette, that made all the difference.  The flavored waters are as delicious as the pastries they have behind the display.  Staff very friendly. Oh, and they have a LGBT library in the corner.  Just come and check it out for yourself.",1,1
Awesome freshly made food and drink for the vegetarian and for the not.  Friendly counter-person who explained the details of the extensive menu and made recommendations.  We'll be back!,1,1
Such amazing fresh food! My favorite is the California Turkey sandwich. Their salad dressing is amazing too.,1,1
"Best sandwiches, soups, and smoothies ever! The staff always remember us and what we like to eat. You can get samples of the vegan soup too! The salad here has the best lemon vinaigrette ever !!! I'll come back without question !",1,1
"I'm from LA with a lot of good food here, but this is the best food I've had in a long time!  We were passing through LV and looking for something healthy so we Yelped ""Vegetarian"" and this place came up with good ratings.  I'm so glad we stopped.  I'm not a vegetarian, but like vegetarian food (and try not to eat too much meat), so my partner and I split the Tree of Life sandwich, and the LGBTQ bacon sandwich.  Both were delicious!  On our way back home 7 days later, I made sure to time it so we could have lunch there.  This time we had the Tree of Life again (so good!) and tried the Good Earth Pita, also vegetarian and also delicious.  And, because I everything was so good, we got 2 salads (The Bizness) to go for us to have for dinner when we got home in LA a few hours later.  And yes, they were just as delicious as the sandwiches.  Oh, as was the banana bread we got for a snack for the car.  To top it off, the staff was super friendly and helpful.  We ended up meeting Peter and David, the owners, and I wish them the best of luck.    I don't normally gush about a place like I am now, but I don't normally have delicious, healthy food at a reasonable price.  I just hope I didn't over sell it.",1,1
"Amazing, love that the bread is vegan as well, was skeptical about that at first, but They confirmed that for me that made me come back for another one the following week! Kind of stingy on the sauce for the salad, but overall, a great vegan sandwich.",1,1
The Tree of Life sandwich is amazing!  Not only is the food great but the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.,1,1
The bizness is everything! =D  You can mix and match 3 toppings you put with the kale salad. The salad has a lot of flavor. I love the brussel sprouts and chickpeas!,1,1
"We were searching for an amazing salad and sandwich place in Vegas and we found it! We ordered the bacon chop chop salad and it was so huge and filling, with lots of delicious nuggets of flavor throughout. She ordered an extra side of croutons that are torn pieces and packed with tons of flavor and a little kick. I ordered the what what sandwich. The combo of turkey and pepperoni with the greens and basil aioli was so delicious. And top it off with this ciabatta bread that's crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. He got the Miss Piggy sandwich, which was a chicken salad with bacon and green goddess dressing, basil aioli and lemon vinaigrette. Unbelievable combination of flavors. I tried a hot tea - maple apple cider. It was delicious. I highly recommend trying this cafe.",1,1
"Worth the walk!  We woke up this morning at the Plaza wondering where to go for breakfast.  We read the reviews on Yelp and as a nutritarian we were happy to see a menu that is vegan.  We arrived and were not disappointed!  The staff was amazing, gave us great recommendations, and also shared other vegan friendly stops for us to try around town.  We got the Match a superfoods smoothy,  delicious and nutritious.  We also got the good earth pita, and the tree of life pita.  They offered to split the pitas so we each got a box with half of each in it which wss thoughtful.  ""So good!""  It was a healthful way to start the day but we felt that we indulged, fabulously tasty!! THEY ALSO DELIVER! We look forward to ordering more items throughout our weekend stay.  Everyone we met there was super friendly and helpful.  We highly recommend to vegan and non vegan alike!",1,1
"First time here and the food was excellent. Lots of options, especially if you're vegan and gluten-free. I got the green goddess sandwich which was a chicken salad sandwich. The chicken was excellent, flavored with pesto and delicious veggies. The bread was very good as well. Wanted to try the vegan pastries but was a bit full after my delicious meal. Great place for food and the workers were pretty great as well. Very accommodating and ready to answer any questions.",1,1
I love this place but you need to change your hours listed! Not open until 10 am instead of 7 like it says!,1,1
"Just came here! It's delicious!  They have many gf vegan options and also non vegan items.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with gf bread. It was delicious homemade bread! The side salad was also great with a tangy dressing!   My bf had the complicated sandwich! It was huge with ""more bacon than I've  ever seen in a sandwich""! Delicious!   We also got a chai with almond milk! It was fantastic ! Carmen made it super frothy whichever it extra amazing!!!  I also tried different flavors of the gf vegan cheesecake made in house.  They were all delicious but my faves were: the vanilla! (Tastes kind of like a custard. Very good! ) the mango (!) and the chocolate which was made with raw organic chocolate and was with a mousse-like consistency.  Finally I had to have a ginger snap- gf vegan. It was hard (for dipping into tea) but still pretty good.  Overall this place is awesome! It's a small cafe but I wouldn't be surprised if they open in a space of their own soon!   Also the service was spectacular! Thanks Carmen!!!",1,1
"I wish Yelp would post all of my old photos from here along with my review because I used to come here often in between or after my classes for lunch. Bronze Cafe is inside The Center so there's no signage when you drive by. There's plenty of parking unlike at other places downtown.  I love how everything here is fresh. They give samples of their soup of the day , cheesecakes and iced coffee. I get their miso soup whenever they have it for the soup of the day - surprisingly better than the miso soup at some Japanese restaurants imo. Coconut curry soup is great as well.   I have not tried any item that I did not like except for the ""complicated order"" sandwich since I'm not a fan of the bacon jam or bacon in general. My favorite is their ""Good Earth"" pita (9.95$) which is a soft & delicious pita bread w/ spring mix , lemon vinaigrette , roasted vegetables ,  mushrooms , hummus , sprouts and spicy sunflower seeds inside. I like this over their ""Tree of Life"" pita (although that one is still really good) since the spicy sunflower seeds adds a nice crunch. Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian , it's a must try. I also love their Bizness salad (9.95$). I normally don't even get salads when I eat out but their salad is the best. It's a lemon vinaigrette massaged kale salad base + any 3 sides.   They also have a great drink selection although they discontinued my favorite matcha blended smoothie. They can recreate it though but it depends who's working. They still have the matcha superfoods blended smoothie (6.50$) but it's more of a protein shake.   Food is expensive , salads/sandwiches/wraps start at 8.95-12.90$. They have student discounts but still pricey. However if you're into eating healthy , Bronze Cafe is worth looking into.",1,1
Two words... Refreshingly delicious! I've been here a few times with my mother an have left feeling so satisfied and looking forward to my next visit. Definitely recommend this place if you haven't already tried it.,1,1
"Came here after reading all the reviews so my expectations were high. I ordered the tree of life pita and it was delicious, lots of flavor. It also comes with a small salad. They allow free samples or their sides and cheesecakes. I really liked the strawberry one, but they were all out. This place would easily be 5 stars, but the prices are a bit high. The pita was $10.",1,1
"OMG!  The ciabatta bread is so soft and fresh!  The worker said that the bread was delivered the same  morning from a nearby bakery.  The peanut butter chocolate chip vegan cheesecake is out of this world!  Excellent cafe for both vegans and non-vegans alike.  All the paper menu items are marked whether they are vegan or gluten-free.    Don't let it scare you that the cafe is inside the LGBT Center. Everyone is friendly, even if you are straight.",1,1
"The food was fresh, healthy, creative and delicious. Service was on par. Vegas needs more places like this.",1,1
"Visited on 7/21/2014   The Tree of Life pita was probably one of the most delicious vegetarian meals I have ever tried. I do not know how they get the textures of the vegetables to emulate the taste and feel of eating a meaty sandwich, but they do it, and they do it well. The staff was very friendly and gave me a thorough description of my possible options. Easily a recommended place, and definitely worth a return...Also had the ""Loving vs. Virginia"" cookie for dessert. Simply amazing!",1,1
"By far my favorite restaurant downtown. I headed here for brunch and got the mocha blended coffee, good earth pita and vegan cheesecake. Definitely the perfect spot for a health foodie. The food is filling and nourishing, it's well worth the price.",1,1
"Who knew healthy could taste so good!  I had a friend in town who partied a little too hard over the weekend, so he wanted to start his week off right on a healthy note. I took him on a hike and then over here for dinner. I had previously sampled their food while volunteering at an event they catered, so I was excited to get full portions this time. First off, the bizness salad is delicious. I had this with chickpeas, beats and quinoa, but there's other topping options you can go for. I could probably eat this every day. The tree of life pita is also a great choice- packed full of veggies on a warm pita. Now maybe not the healthiest option on the menu, but the Complicated Order is a must. This has bacon, BACON JAM, avocado, turkey, tomatoes and greens, all on a perfectly toasted ciabatta bun. The bacon jam is pretty awesome, and if I had a jar at home I'd probably put it on just about everything.   Bronze is located inside The Center, so don't get confused when you don't see a storefront. We came in on a Monday night while an open mic night was going on so it was pretty crowded. There are a bunch of tables around though so we were able to find a few open seats and watch some free entertainment.   Even though this is a bit of a trek from my house, I'll be back!",1,1
I absolutely love Bronze! I've been eating here for 2 years now and every time it's delicious. You can order for delivery which is exactly what I did today. I work at atomic style lounge in the arts district so bronze is super convenient  for me. Their Vegan choices are so delicious you won't even realize it's vegan food. Today I decided to be bad and I got the what what sandwich which has turkey and pepperoni and omg I'm so glad I got it definitely recommend this place to anyone!,1,1
"Went with my boyfriend to Bronze Cafe and I really enjoyed it :) I got a sandwich and it was delicious, the vegan desserts looked really good! I will need to try one next time.",1,1
"The bizness with roasted broccoli, curried chickpeas, and roasted brussel sprouts is AMAZING!!!  The tree of life is delish!",1,1
"This place hits the spot when I'm in the mood for something healthy yet flavorful. Not only is the food great, but the staff is always so genuinely nice. It's located downtown inside the LGBTQ community center. Not exactly the best of areas but don't let that scare you away.   Everything I've tried has been delicious. I love the LGBTQ sandwich because, duh, bacon jam! Don't worry, the sandwich has plenty of veggies to help you curb the guilt. The vegan options are great as well. I had the tree of life pita just the other day and it was delicious. The sandwiches are served with a side of greens tossed in a lemon vinaigrette. I personally love sour but my boyfriend hates it. Even better for me because I get double the servings. Just a warning for those who hate tart flavors. Not sure if they have other options but you can always ask.   In fact, if you're ever not satisfied, just let them know. I got one of those brownie/cookie things once, and it was rock hard. They were apologetic and happy to exchange it for something else. Love this place!",1,1
Found another Vegan spot to eat at in Vegas. Food is great. Join the Vegan revolution! Being healthy is the new gangsta!,1,1
Tasty food and excellent service at this little cafe.  I'm impressed.,1,1
"We came here for an early lunch. Hubby had a buy one get one free. We almost missed this place because it is located inside a business.   Hubby ordered me a strawberry lemon grass basil drink. It was pretty good but there was no sugar in it which is healthy for me. He also got me a California turkey sandwich with a salad. The bread on the sandwich was crunchy and fresh. Inside was turkey, avocado and lots of lettuce which included spinach. Every bite was good. Fresh ingredients inside every bite. Sandwich was good. Everything we got was pretty expensive. You get what you pay for. With the coupon, it still totaled to $27. Still not bad since everything was fresh and tasty.   There was table service. The guy brings out your sandwiches. After we were done eating, the nice lady took away our plates. They were disposable plates and we were given plastic forks. Nice and friendly people here. I would definitely come back to try other sandwiches.",1,1
"This place is awesome. Got the David's Special salad and it's phenomenal, so many amazing flavors! Also the dirty bird blended, which is a Chai latte blended with espresso beans and I substituted almond milk, it's a great combination. Their soup of the day is a vegan coconut corn curry and it is also phenomenal! Great service, very friendly and fast! I'm not vegetarian or vegan but this food is great!",1,1
"Why have I never Yelped about Bronze Cafe before? It's the perfect place to get a satisfying meal that you won't feel guilty about. Everything I've ever had here is amazing. My go-to is the Tree of Life pita. The menu isn't strictly vegan, but there are many Vegan delights...including from the expansive bakery case and smoothy menu. The staff behind the counter is great and the tables in the lobby of The Center are comfortable.",1,1
"The Food is Great! The Caring from the owners, Dave and Peter, is to the Moon! Please come back and support healthy living and eating!",1,1
"it is worth all the hype!  i loved it!  fresh, flavorful, healthy, interesting!!!!!  just go!",1,1
"Amazing and delicious food! Definitely coming back! There are some other places that serve vegan in the area, but this is by far the best and tastiest!   The interior is inviting and very open!",1,1
"Great vegan option in dtlv. They also have a market that has a lot of difficult to find elsewhere products. I highly recommend the salad bar. As they say, 'they'll toss your salad if you ask nice' LOLZ!",1,1
Wow! Once again I'm blown away with fresh ingredients and layers of taste.  Go now and ask for the David Special! You're welcome.,1,1
"I had a boxed lunch there yesterday (guac & mole sandwich with small side salad) and a side dish that I don't recognize on the menu that is posted on grubhub.  I think it had kale, chickpeas, toasted almonds, some granola, I think, and a delicious dressing, maybe more ingredients.  It was really tasty.  There was nothing special about the hummus or pita chips other than I think they made the pita chips themselves, but the flavors in the sandwich and side salad were wonderful.  I'll qualify my review by saying I don't eat lunch out much, so there might be other excellent places out there, but my boxed lunch yesterday was the best I have had in Vegas and very comparable to the delicious boxed lunches I used to get occasionally at meetings in Denver that were catered by Udi's, for anyone who is familiar with them.",1,1
"This is a diamond in the rough place. Great sandwiches! For the price, you get a lot! Staff are quick and precise.",1,1
"This place is a hidden gem! Omg, I got the guac and mole with the 24oz just too good both incredibly delicious! The center is beautiful, spacious, with a chill vibe perfect for late night study sessions or a casual meet. A must check out!",1,1
"The yummiest David's Special salad, and sandwiches and scones and HUMMUS! Really great food!!",1,1
"Oh my God, this place is amazing!  I just placed an order for delivery tonight (after having moved to Las Vegas today), and I am blown away by the quality and taste.  I just ate a sandwich that I think may qualify as the best sandwich (the California Turkey) I have ever eaten in my entire life.  No, really.  It was soooo good, and they didn't need to add tons and tons of ingredients to make it that good.  Everything tasted so fresh, the bread was absolutely delicious, and the oil and other toppings were in exactly the right proportions.  I'm not worried about blowing all my money on gambling in this town; I'm worried about blowing it all at this restaurant!  Actually, the prices are fair for such high quality.  Lots of options, too.  I'm sure I will try everything eventually.    I also wanted to give a warm shout out to my SUPER friendly and helpful delivery guy!  I am lucky that this was my first meal as a Vegas local. I think I am going to be here or order here A LOT.  Hope they don't get sick of me.  ha     A+!",1,1
"Wow! Just love this place! I purchased a groupon for this cafe for a sammitch, cookie (of some sort, I got monkey bread) and a soup for 11 bucks and let me tell you that is a steal! This place is inside a LGBTQ center, when you first walk in bronze Cafe is right in your face. They have a variety of vegan/non-vegan items to eat and so my boyfriend got a turkey sammitch with bacon and I got the vegan the tree life of pita sammitch....with our mushroom soup (also vegan) and our dessert (vegan). Yeah it was pretty freakin awesome and one hella of a delicious meal! Everything was tasty and wouldn't change a thing! I really enjoyed the atmosphere of it all and especially the sharing of the restroom with everyone (yes there is stalls to do your business) but loved the place overall!",1,1
"We have dined here for lunch several times and almost always order the same 2 items, but I had my mind set on a nice healthy salad only to discover these are pre-made so we both ended up ordering our usual.  The Tree of Life, a vegan sandwich with roasted red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, house made pickled onions, cashew crema, Brazil nut crumble and mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette on pita flatbread for my wife.   I tossed thoughts of eating healthy to the wind and ordered the LGBTQ = house made bacon jam (Yes!), maple cured bacon (Yes!), basil aioli, mixed greens, lemon vinaigrette on a ciabatta roll.  Were these delicious?  Yes!",1,1
"I've had a tough time finding healthy food options in town and came across this gem of a place purely by chance. Once here I was blown away by the staff and their friendly demeanor, the healthy food options (a big vegan menu), and the quality of the food.  In ordered the Tree of Life sandwich and was very happy with the result.  It was packed full of fresh ingredients and the overall flavor of it was astounding. I didn't feel overly full but was perfectly satisfied.  I'll definitely be coming back here for more!",1,1
"Bronze Cafe is THE BEST! The food is exceptional - healthy, delicious, generous portions. The service is equally amazing - everyone is always friendly, welcoming and kind. Definitely one of the hidden Vegas gems.",1,1
The Tree of Life sandwich is very delicious. Ice filtered coffee is very tasty. Great place for Vegans and non Vegans. The vegan cheesecakes are off the hook!,1,1
"Not sure what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said... I ordered the bizness, which is a kale salad that you can pick 3 accompaniments for- it was very flavorful. Husband had a sandwich on house made gluten free bread - super good!   Loved the strawberry gluten free vegan cheesecake.   Top 5 vegan friendly lunch places I've been to!",1,1
"When a coworker said there was a new spot downtown that had good vegetarian and vegan offerings, and some really good salads (which is all I ever want in this heat!) I was super excited to try it.   Parking was plentiful, and the cafe space inside The Center was bright, clean, inviting and comfortable.   I chose the Good Earth Vegan sandwich and the cantaloupe and turmeric water. The Pita sandwich was huge, and loaded with mushrooms, egg plant, peppers, sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes and some amazing hummus. It was served with a nice, fresh little side salad with a lemony dressing on it. The quality was fantastic, and the price was quite reasonable.   I'm already perusing the menu, deciding what I'm going to get when I go back.",1,1
Top notch service and innovative food! Delicious! Unique drinks and excellent coffee shop selections.  Some days I feel the need to go Vegan or vegetarian and I run here! Also desserts are scrumptious!,1,1
I ate here today and I was more than satisfied as usual. I'm vegan and I've tried everything vegan on the menu. It is always fresh and made to order. I love the California Tofurkey and the fresh soup of the day. I will keep coming back for more. Their desserts are made from local bakeries and include gluten free and vegan options. Thanks for the great food and friendly service !!,1,1
"Loved Bronze Cafe!! My boyfriend and I recently went on a Vegan health kick, and its not easy to find Vegan food in Vegas. Bronze Cafe is located in some place called ""The Center,"" so you might pass by it the first drive by, but its worth the U-turn, so turn around and go inside!! I had some amazing Vegan sweets, which are so hard to find! Great butternut squash soup and the mole sandwich! The three guys working the counter were super sweet and very friendly! Can't wait to go back!",1,1
"I absolutely love this place. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is exceptional. They have a great variety of food, drinks, and pastries. My favorites is the it's complicated sandwich and bacon scone. It is definitely a hidden gem.",1,1
Absolutely awesome. it was quick. It was delicious. Two unfortunate things...smoothies underwhelming and hardly any gluten free options. But the sandwiches and service were killer.,1,1
The guy (cashier)who helped us was awesome. We tried the vegan chili. Yummy. The tree of life pita...oh my. So good. My brother who is not vegan loved it. I got all kinds of bake goods too. All of them good. I recommend the brownie chocolate chip cookie. Everything was awesome. Definitely coming back. :) Thank you to the cashier guy who was wonderful. :),1,1
"This place is very nice and clean. Intimate lighting. Classy. Nice selection of GOOD beers, excellent food. Overall, a very nice atmosphere.",1,1
"The Paddock is Toronto's 3rd oldest bar. That in itself is enough reason to go visit, but their beer selection makes it worthwhile too. See my pic of the German Hopf beer on tap which was sampled and it was delicious and fresh. The history of the Paddock is illustrious and colourful, alive with Toronto spirit and decadence. The decor is dark wood, mysterious and rich in tone and feel. It's not a large space, but well proportioned and airy, despite being dark. There are two large TV screens, on adjacent walls, so it would be a good place to watch a game. The bartender was friendly and had some great tunes playing on his iTunes computer. It's off the beaten tourist path of Queen St. West and well worth the small detour south of the Pizza joint on the corner.",1,1
The Paddock Tavern is one of those classic places in Toronto that you would love to stop in and share a pint with friends. The interior has the classic wood and leather combo of old taverns. They won't sell you a bottled beer so domestic fans beware. Live acts are often found here on the weekends that liven the place up with a great blues vibe.,1,1
What a great old school joint. Always different and interesting beer on tap and great tasting food.  Come for the beer stay for the music.,1,1
"Wandered into this spot for drinks (and drinks only) after dinner on a Friday night. It's a bit muddy in there; dim lighting, not too loud, and everything's got the faintest touch of, let's call it, ""history."" But it's charming in an art deco kind of way, and I can imagine a lot of mysterious trysts have transpired under the Paddock's roof. Probably a few mob hits too.  Although there is ample seating at their tables, you'll want to pony up to the expansive bar. The L-shaped beast has to be at least 30 feet long, with old-school stools that swivel, and super-friendly bartenders who are quick to suggest a decent shot. They seemed to have a lot of beers on tap (I'd guess 10) including Big Rock, so I was a fan. Don't really know what drinks cost, but it seemed reasonable for the locale.  This place has a vibe that suggests almost anything can go down in this place. With a small patio out front, I see potential.  Obligatory Title Pun: Give this DOCtor a spin.  Menu Readability: Like I said, drinks and drinks only. I'll come back and report.  Need to mention: Pretty small washroom, brah. Don't go if you value privacy.  What this place teaches me about myself: I might look good in a fedora. No, probably not.",1,1
"I stopped by the Chandler location on Friday night. I felt bad because I couldn't get in until about 30 minutes before close. The young men working didn't act phased at all treated me very well with excellent customer service and helped me pick out my first pair of skates. The guy that helped me was obviously very knowledgeable about all of your products and took his time helping me pick out the perfect pair.  I won't shop anywhere else for hockey gear, you've created a dedicated customer for life!",1,1
"I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM.",1,1
"Okay, first of all I would like to say thank you all so much to the entire staff of this wonderful hotel. I come to Las Vegas three times a year as a drag racer to the Las Vegas motor Speedway. The previous hotel that I used to stand was 17.5 miles away the aviation in his 3 miles from the track I love it. I was there on Thanksgiving weekend and brand ask told me it was going to be $125 more per night for Friday Saturday and Sunday. So I thought and let me check around. I found the aviation in the rates were incredibly affordable and the hotel was astonishingly nice I could not believe my eyes when I walked in the my room. Comfortable, quiet comfortable customer service extraordinary, just an excellent hotel to stay in for me. The maid one day was cleaning my room as I was leaving for the track she came running out with $40 in her hand and said Sir Sir you dropped this. The honesty of that woman was incredible so I let her keep the money but I just have to say there are not a lot of people that would have done that. Just a terrific,  wonderful hotel and that girl that runs the show at night top of the list in customer service I could not believe it. I thought she was the manager. If you need a nice place to stay in Vegas that is affordable comfortable and quiet and just an all-around really really nice place to stay this is it right here aviation Inn has it all over the rest of them as far as I'm concerned. I am overjoyed and very pleased. Oh just one more thing, brand X, the other hotel, the Wi-Fi went down about three or four times a night when I was there. Not once did it go down at aviation Inn. Another Goldstar!!",1,1
Great discounted burning man shopping and beyond. She's a sweetheart and this a legit small business worthy to support!!!,1,1
"The staff is very friendly. Probably the best interaction I've ever had with any location. It's a bit small though and I could see how it could get overcrowded. I've only been off peak hours though, so it's been fine. I like the variety of equipment that they have. Maybe not the best but better than average.",1,1
Great class times! Suits my busy schedule. Love the 430 body pump on Thursday's!,1,1
"ME AND THE GYM BREAK UP AND GET BACK TOGETHER ALL THE TIME.  Hello Good Life! I've been a member at the St. Clair location for over three years and they do a great job. The clientele at this location are friendly, motivated and NOT intimidating.  Good Life Fitness is the best option in Toronto (I say) for many reasons:  -Helpful staff. -Clean facilities, well stocked. -They update their machines constantly (at least that money goes somewhere right?) -Very nice layout.  If you decide to join, make sure you negotiate a good rate. There's always a money-saving promotion, so take advantage. And like Hal Johnson and Joanne McLeod would say, ""Keep Fit, And Have Fun!""",1,1
"Four stars because, hey, five stars only if I was actually enjoying what I'm doing there, right? Going to the gym for me is nothing but a chore, and a bad one, one of those you get tired doing. I'm past the time to believe that one gym will make me ""want"" to work out, so with that said I must say I wouldn't expect anything more from a gym than what I get from this one.  The place is conveniently located on the St Clair Centre, a few steps from the north exit of the St Clair subway station - great if you need to run some errand after the workout, such as getting some groceries on the Loblaws that sits atop of the gym or get some stamps at the post office nearby.  It's pretty big inside. Lots and lots of machines for weight training and cardio. Everything looks pretty clean and you can hardly see something out of order - mostly one treadmill or another. Sometimes in peak hours there is a wait for somethings, but I've really seen worst in other places.  Bought a personal trainer package when I signed up and I met a great guy named Alex which really gave me a boost at the beginning - he's not there anymore, though. People from the front desk are very nice and helpful.  The only thing better would be if they found a way for me to stay fit and healthy while relaxing on their sofas...",1,1
"I like this Goodlife over the others close to me for a couple of reasons...the workout schedule has a nice variety of classes and times (not limited to LesMills classes), the new shower area is awesome, the spin studio is large enough for almost any class and the staff has always seemed to be genuinely happy and enjoying their job...makes it a good experience all round!",1,1
"I thought the prices were totally reasonable and the portions totally reasonable also. Had an Italian Sausage sub -my only complaint was that the bread fell apart at the bottom so I had to use a fork to eat it, otherwise, pretty good.  Everything was definitely delicious, though the boys I went with ordered a sandwich called the Big Volt - aka heart attack on a plate. I'll try and upload a photo of it. They both said it was good.. I have a hard time believing that.  They tried the pizza, on their sandwiches, but I'm not entirely able to comment on that. Service was also friendly.",1,1
Great food! Prices are very reasonable especially for the large portions they give you. Very quick delivery. My only complaint is the chunky sauce only because i am a picky eater.,1,1
"Oh. Yum! We got the pizza roll and a brocolli, cheddar and chicken pizza and it was soooo good! The dough is obviously homemade, the sauce is fabulous, the pizza was just-mm! C'est magnifique! Very casual dining room and friendly prompt service, will definitely come again if we come to Cleveland again!",1,1
Delicious!  If you haven't tried Guilin bonanzas pizzeria and you live near by then you are really missing out. It may not be a famous *insert style* pizza that you have had elsewhere but it's definitely better than the cheapo $5 large from the other guys.,1,1
Its a great little mom and pop shop alot better than a chain restaurant food was good I love there wings tasty pizza too,1,1
Amazing service and great pizza I got 2 slices of pepperoni and as I am almost done she asked if I would be interested in another slice they were 2.50 each or 3 for 6 so I got It I spent 8.50 for lunch with a drink. preparation is simple the pizza spoke for itself oil and parmesan  sprinkled on the crust if you are in mentor OH it's with it,1,1
"Dinner with my girlfriend before catching a movie. There are a few tables and booths. As usual, we shared everything we ordered. We both started with a side salad with house dressing. Both were excellent. We had a supreme calzone and small chicken and broccoli white pizza. The food was great and there was plenty to share and take home for later.",1,1
"This is a nice spot for take out or delivery. The pizza is excellent and the chicken and sandwiches are good. Nothing fancy just quality food. The only draw back is their pastas. Bland by our taste, we had to doctor ours up when we got home and started thinking, maybe we should've just made our own to begin with. I just got the volt. Nice way to sample a couple different items. Chicken tenders, mozz sticks between two pieces of pepperoni pizza, my wife was concerned I might have a heart attack but it was good.",1,1
"My coworkers  turned me on to this place a couple wks ago...been addicted ever since!!!    Top notch pizza! Got the New Yorker w extra cheese, pepperoni & sausage....excellent excellent Excellent!! Did i say EXCELLENT?? Lol. Thanks guys, once again u totally rocked it out!!!",1,1
"Great Pizza...Very good dough...home made on premises not your typical ""Shell"" Crust. Fresh toppings and friendly staff. Will go back here again in a heart beat.",1,1
"Stopped in for dinner before catching a movie. Started with a salad with house Italian dressing and some monkey bread. The dipping sauce that came with the bread was delicious  as was the bread. I was dining with my boyfriend so we shared a supreme calzone and small chicken and broccoli white pizza. The pizza crust was excellent, not to thin or to thick. The calzone was phenomenal. There was food leftover to take home and enjoy later.  I'm sure we will be back here again.",1,1
"I have gone to this Verizon location several times. Sometimes for a simple problem, but sometimes for ""headaches"". I stop by after church on Sunday's about 1 pm. The same young woman is there every time and she is EXCELLENT!!  she is friendly, helps me with options, and answers my questions clearly. I have also watched her with other customers. She is the same with them. I now drive from Surprise to Sun City because I know that my problems will be solved when I shop here.   Today she was there but a really nice gentleman helped me. He even went to my car to see exactly what I needed. Thank you.",1,1
"Very knowledgeable, friendly and HELPFUL staff! They made sure I left the store informed about my new phone and I also left the store very well protected and didn't even spend much! Will definitely be referring people to this location or any TCC location. Thanks guys!",1,1
"I want to compliment one of your excellent employees, Zaid Ayyoub. He went to great lengths to help my mother with her many phone issues. She received quality service at your Sun City branch, and Zaid extended help is a prime example of 1st class customer service. He knew just what to do to solve her problem quickly and couldn't have been more kind.  Such service builds great relationships. I will always recommend all my associates and friends needs needs to TCC in Sun City from now on.  Thank you, John Muller",1,1
Great show! The preformances were real good and the girls were having fun. The singing and dancing reminded me of the movie burlesque but shorter version. This a must see! For women and men.  I went with a guy friend and be liked it as well and not just the top less girls. Buy the groupon or get the 2-1 deal if they still have it.,1,1
"This was such an AWESOME show. Me & my husband went, while on our honeymoon, he got pulled on stage too, and we enjoyed it so much. They were celebrating their 200th show, I'm so glad we got to experience that with them. The girls had great energy & just looked like they truly enjoy what they are doing. I would definitely recommend this show. We loved it",1,1
Excellent performance.  Jennifer was amazing on the pole and bathtub.  Very professionally presented.  Enjoyed the hula hoops and the musical entertainment as well as an excellent dance performance.  Would highly recommend for anyone visiting Vegas.,1,1
"Omg I attended this show with my husband and I loveeeeeed it. I mean we both did lol. At first I thought I was going to feel out of place because I thought it was going to be only men, but there were all kinds of people , couples, mid aged and old age, which was pretty cool. Just like other reviewers said, it's not just about the girls, it's also about talent. The girls are gorgeous and very talented ! Especially, Jennifer Romas she is a super strong gal!!! Check it out , you won't be disappointed , I will come again in the future with more friends ;)",1,1
"Awesome show. Beautiful girls. Very well choreographed. Worth watching.  Tip: If you are VIP - it's first come first serve VIP seats. General admission - it's the same first come first serve.  Cons:  I don't think it's worth paying $70 for VIP if you come early with general admission. I had a VIP tickets for six and was seated in general admission because they over sold plus they couldn't put my party together.   If you are seated on the top most row. Which will happen if all the good visual seats are taken you will miss 1/3 rd of the show because you cannot see any of the pole dancing, dancing with the audience.   The last top most row should be completely closed of.   But overall a very good show to see.",1,1
"A high energy, steamy yet classy production that was well worth the ticket to make a great night out.",1,1
"I love going to this location, by far the most friendly, cleanest and a great distance from my house. The girls in there are so nice and always make you feel comfortable. The only negative which isn't to bad is the parking. I usually walk there so I normally don't have to deal with it. I will always go to this location when I need a cup of coffee.",1,1
"In the shade in the morning.   Great outdoor seating area.   Friendly regulars.  Good coffee.  Fresh pastries (in the morning).     All in all, it's a nice version of a chain coffee store.    The line will be out-the-door long in the morning until about 10:00am or so, but don't let that scare you:  They work through the line quickly.     This is the favorite Starbucks of several of my friends in the area -- and considering they have about 5 to choose from in a mile vicinity, that should say a lot.",1,1
I really like Loretta at this location. She was cheerful and got my drinks with a smile. Happy for great customer service and kindness!!,1,1
I love this Starbucks! GREAT customer service from Anna and Nancy in particular. This Starbucks is ALWAYS busy and the staff is super fast and efficient.  I can get out the door in 10 minutes with a line out the door. I have personally witnessed RUDE customers in here and the staff always responds appropriately.  I honestly choose to go to this one over other ones in the area for the effiency and they are always stocked on their food choices. LOVE this one!!,1,1
"So the only reason I ever stop in at this particular Starbuck is because it is on my way to the gym and I almost always need a Double Espresso to get me through the cardio.  I always, always... always get the same thing. Doppio with no lid, and then I ask for the soy milk. It's kind of a bummer to me that they don't remember. I'm not expecting it or think I'm special or anything, but I've seen two or three of the baristas every time i go in. Hmph. My mom always told me I was special...  Beware when there is a line. The Scottsdale Mommies or whoever they are get all in a tizzy when their Venti Black Tea Lemonade is made with Green Tea instead. I mean REALLY, i TOLD him Black Tea. Wasn't he listening??   Yuck.  As a side note. There is always a very cute guy with a beard sitting outside working on his laptop. Just sayin'.",1,1
"Love this location, not that I've ever experienced a bad one but these guys are super friendly and have never messed up an order yet. We love to take the puppies and sit on the patio with other friendly dog owners",1,1
"The friendly baristas keep their cool even when the line is out the door, which it frequently is! Lots of regulars and their dogs hanging outside on the weekends when the weather is nice!",1,1
Always a good cup of coffee at this location! The barista's here are awesome... especially a girl named Marissa! So nice and helpful!  Avoid coming here in the morning rush.... HUGE lines!,1,1
"Love this place because of the service in spite of it getting swamped, weekdays in the morning -The line can be out the door. On those days I use the app to order ahead. My order is always there 10 minutes later. But today, Saturday about, 9 I walked up and ordered. I like the crowd, good music of millennials, middle aged with a sprinkling of kids and pets.",1,1
"It's almost silly writing a review for Starbucks - isn't it??  Aren't they all pretty much the same?  Actually, that's the huge upside for Starbucks that you pretty consistently get the same drink no matter what location you stop at.  This location has a great outdoor patio, along with some comfortable seating inside - and the people that work there are always very friendly.  I am amazed at how many of them remember my name and drink preference, especially with the volume of people through there.  Quite often there is a line, but it always moves quickly.  It's a good place to say a quick hi to friends in the morning before tackling the commute and the rest of the day!  The first review says it well - ""All in all, it's a nice version of a chain coffee store""",1,1
"Starbucks at FLW & TP - Lots of space inside but when you have pups, you need LOTS of space outside, and this one does. Including a couple outdoor sofas too between SB and Flos! Two registers, good quick staff, get there early for breakfast treats, they do sell out quick on the popular ones!",1,1
Very busy location but employees work much faster than any other location I have been to in the valley. Store was just redesigned but still much smaller dining area than most locations. Really have to yell your order for them to hear over the chatter of customers.,1,1
"'Yay! I'm a fan' is right. This is one of my favorite Starbucks -- I missed it this weekend during their renovations. The service is great, the drinks are accurate and everyone generally seems pretty happy to be there.   Only complaint: Please carry more of the chocolate croissants. Thank you.",1,1
Starbucks carries a great reputation. LOVE STARBUCKS!,1,1
Great spot.  Quiet and chill.  I got an Iced Passion Fruit Tea sweetened and got to get some work done without all the extra noise and banter that sometimes comes with popular Starbucks locations.,1,1
"Shoutout to Starbucks # 6606   Drove to Scottsdale over turkey day and stopped in many stores.   This was the cleanest , best staff and best hot coffee on our trip   Keep up the good work   Tom M. Texas",1,1
This is the Starbucks closest to my work. I am here EARLY in the morning. The baristas know my drink. I barely have to speak which is good because my brain hasn't fully woken up yet. Great location...no drive-through but not a problem walking in as I am there at a time when there is rarely a huge line.,1,1
"I frequent many a Starbucks and this one is by far how Howard Schultz intended. The staff is always nice, friendly, accommodating and really happy.  They care about what they are serving and always go above and beyond.",1,1
"But you have to love Starbucks customer service online. I reported Claudia's sub-par behavior and they not only apologized and notified the store manager, but also hooked me up with a complimentary beverage of my choosing. We'll see if Claudia received an attitude adjustment next time I visit. Stay tuned!",1,1
"This is the nearest Starbucks from my house. Staff is always friendly, quick and get my order right each time.  Love the new renovations.  Why not 5 stars? I can't give any Starbucks 5 stars until they cut their ties with Monsanto.",1,1
"Very nice facility, very nice staff and great coffee!! I can not complain.",1,1
"Uhm.. starbucks yea... whats a revew for them eh ? Well this location is nice, like everyone before me said. Good outdoor patio gives you a nice place to enjoy the weather - when the weather is reasonable.!  The lines are long-ish in the AM and yet they do work thru them real quick. It is really a nicer version of the chain.",1,1
"This place gets four stars for a few reasons. I'm always amused by the customers, I've received FREE merchandise due to employee error on many occasions, AND the eldery people that put higlighter on your receipt are always so friendly :-)",1,1
"I walked into the auto center knowing I had an oil leak. I'm new to town and didn't know of any other shop. I explained to them that I was new, didn't know where to go and if they had a recommendation. Chad stepped right up and showed me what I needed. He then offered to put the oil in my car for me. Chad was so nice and helpful, he is my hero. I will definitely be back to see him if/when I have any issues.",1,1
"When you're on a quick getaway to Vegas and have dry skin and chapped lips, why not visit this place!?   Ended up with a twelve pack of beer, Mountain Dew Baja blast and four boxes of candy... You know Wal Mart has done their job.  Easy to get to from the hotels and casino on Boulder Highway, this is a clean super center that has everything you need much cheaper than the gift shops inside the hotels.   Tons of parking and AC on full blast!   Price, value and selection, nobody even comes close.   The lines are long when you check out and when you leave as they check your receipt and all your items.   The crowd is sketchy but what Wal Mart doesn't have its share of them lol.  If in the area again, I'll visit this spot for sure.   Thanks Wally World for providing me the products I needed.",1,1
"I came in today to get an oil change, tire rotation & new wiper blades. When I checked out I noticed I was not charged for the tire rotation (because they forgot). The manager of the service center decided to do it for free because they forgot:) Great customer service! Now I know where to go for my next service. Thanks guys:)",1,1
"This review is on the great work of one of the employees in the Electronics dept named Dave.  He was amazing.  He gave me such great advice on my new laptop.  Told me all the good bad and comparisons, asked me questions on what I would be using it for, and then gave me set up advice!!  The store itself is not the greatest, but it gets 5 stars for employees like tall Dave who give 200% to their job and made me feel like a special customer!",1,1
"Walmart don't really vary much store to store. Not the layout, not the goods, not the employees, not the customers.  Long lines do exist at this location but I find that they are pretty good about opening additional lanes if necessary.   If you shop at Walmart, you cannot judge anyone else that comes in the store. I hate pretentious people that shop here and talk crap about the other people that do. *rollseye*  If you are too good for Walmart then stay out.   This location is not as ""ghetto"" as some of the other locations I have experienced living in Las Vegas and most of their cashiers are super friendly.",1,1
"Chad in the tire center Is an outstanding gentleman, and a true professional. Thank you for taking such good care of me, and being thorough in making sure Iam safe in my driving. I hope Walmart recognizes this man. They are fortunate to have him represent the Walmart Brand.",1,1
Big Walmart in Las Vegas with a grocery store and I did do some grocery shopping while I was in here.  It is on Boulder Highway across from Sam's Town and really it is in a more seedy part of town.  The store was really busy but clean and organized it was kinda of picked over in the grocery department as I was looking mainly for produce and it was looking a bit picked over.   The self check out line was long and the lady that was organizing it was a tough 'ol bird as she checked out our basket and gave us a dirty look as we were inept to do the chore.  I prefer to do self check out and am quite capable of doing it.  The WalMart chain are pretty much the same wherever you go and this one wasn't much different.  Kudos for keeping it clean but your staff was a little cranky.,1,1
"Not really much to say, being a Walmart Supercenter and all.  However, the location is prime, it's open 24 hours, and is really conveniently located if you're staying at Sam's Town or the Eastside Cannery across the street.  This is definitely the place you want to hit to stock up on food, snacks and drinks to avoid paying high casino prices.",1,1
"Honest & helpful. Who doesn't love that??!!   The people who work there answer questions honestly, not just based on what you want to hear OR what will sell the most product. That's not common anymore, so I have to give them kudos :)   I meandered around the store, asked about their products & such, but all I really needed was a shaker cup. They didn't hold it against me, lol, so I left happily with my new pink lid shaker cup. Like Mr. Schwarzenegger once said, I'll be back ;)  The only draw back to this new store? It's right next to a Five Guys Burgers, lol.",1,1
"Called in for what I needed, Edwin was friendly and courteous. He even had what I needed at the counter when I arrived! How do you recommend this location! Thank you Edwin!",1,1
The lady was awesome with our dog Samson. He is allergic to fleas and was constantly scratching. When we left she also gave us a bottle of some menthol stuff to put on him. He looked great and oranges around for days.,1,1
Bucky Adam's is a hole in the wall groomer but they are so friendly and do a great job at an affordable price! My dog is always excited when we pull up! They let the dogs be loose (as long as everyone is being nice) instead of being locked in a crate all day.,1,1
"Awesome little dive bar. Great burgers. Good beer. Nice, causal divey feel to it. Good sized bar even though the stools are getting a little worn. It's got two nice pool tables too!",1,1
"We have had them tint several of our vehicles' windows, as well as purchased trailer hitches and bumpers from them. They have replaced my tint twice for no charge due to a chemical getting on it and a scratch caused by me. The management has great integrity and their products and service of very high quality!",1,1
"I called at noon on a Friday and was given an appointment for 3:30 to have an electtic trailer brake controller installed in my truck.  I arrived a little early, was greeted immediately, and presented with three different options for controller units.  The various features and prices were well explained.  There was no pressure to buy the pricier unit (although I did choose it).  I was told that the installation would take about 30 mins. The technician got started right away and brought me out to the vehicle so that I could choose the exact mounting location and bracket design.  He was very patient and ultimately placed the unit exactly where I requested.  I was out the door and happily on my way at 4:00.  I saved $100 over the fee quoted by a local RV dealer.  Impressive!",1,1
"Got a groupon on line.  Called the next day, and was able to get in the following morning.  Hardly any wait time,finished the tint on only my 2 front windows (the others were already tinted)  In and out in about an hours time.Paid $40.00 for the Groupon which was valued at $100 ~ had a balance of like 5 dollars,  Great Deal!  We are extreamly impressed with how the windows look.  Would recommend this place!",1,1
What a refreshing company to do business with ! We've used them for Bedliners and most recently a fifth wheel hitch . After the hitch gave us problems and the manufacturer wouldn't stand by their product quality bumper stepped up to the plate and took care of everything ! I wouldn't shop anywhere else. Thanks for the amazing customer service,1,1
"Very pleased with the customer service and quality of work. Quality Bumper not only gave me the best price for a trailer hitch for my 2016 Jeep Renegade, but did a great job adding tint to my front door windows. Special thanks to Dennis who truly went the extra mile in customer service. We would definitely recommend this business as a great choice.",1,1
I just moved to AZ from NorCal. The tinting of your front windows in CA is illegal so I was very eager to get it done here. I looked around online then decided to check out Groupon. Quality Bumper had a groupon priced at $40.00 with a value of $100.00. I have had my front windows done before in CA (illegally) and paid around the amount of $85.00 so when I saw this I thought it was a great deal. I called Quality Bumper and got an appointment for first thing the next morning at 8:00 am.being new to the area I wasn't sure how long it was gonna take me to get there and ended up arriving at 7:45. I walked in even though they didn't open and was greeted. They asked me to hang out for a couple minutes and I did. The sales guy talked to me about the different types of tints and said I might as well maximize the groupon and get the best one they had. I went with his advice and it only cost me an addition $4 and some change. I knew I was early so it didn't bother me to. They started to work on my car tinting the front windows only and told me it was about an hour of work. I hung out with my iPad and they offered me the remote to the tv and said I could watch what I wanted. I thought that was pretty cool. By the time I found something to watch I heard my name. My car was ready to go! Best part is it only took them 20 minutes. I was in and out of there before any other customers showed up! I got the tinting done the same day as I am writing this so as far as longevity and quality of the product I don't know yet but I'm sure it will be fine. I've never had any issues in the past.  As far as the tint job they did I am so far very happy with it and would recommend my friends to go here. Just remember to check our groupon.com to see if they have anything on there. It was totally worth it!,1,1
Awesome service!! I came in and had my 4runner tinged with the ceramic tint and they were extremely helpful in helping me decide what grade of tint I wanted and explained the benefits of it. They were not pushy at all and scheduled an appointment for the next day. The appointment took 45 minutes and the job came out great! I have no complaints and would definitely come back.,1,1
"I bought a Groupon for window tinting at Quality Bumper. Glad I did. I called to make an appointment and was able to get in the next day. When I arrived, the employees at the desk were eager to please, very professional and courteous. I was told exactly what kind of tinting was going to be installed and how long it would take. There was a small waiting area in the showroom.    There was a good stream of people coming in and out, and the employees really knew what they were talking about. No pressure sales.   My car was ready when they told me it would be.  They did a great job with the tinting, gave me care instructions for the next week and thanked me very much for coming in.   Great service and quality work.  Would recommend Quality Bumper and would definitely go back!",1,1
"I have here for breakfast every time I am staying at this hotel - as breakfast is part of the room rate.  The servers and staff are all friendly, helpful, and prompt.  They do get busy (note: the peak hours are 7-8am when almost all the tables are taken).  The cook for the omelette station is very polite and pretty prompt and accurate with all the orders.  The only odd thing is the breakfast food stations (including the omelette chef) are in a tiny enclosed room.   When the restaurant is busy, it can get uncomfortable with everyone trying to navigate to the food without blocking or touching each other.  I try to leave C$3-5 tip each time but I notice some people don't tip thinking the service gratuity is free!",1,1
"My review is based solely on brunch @ Crave  I have been to Crave twice now. The first time was for Christmas Day brunch and the 2nd time was just a couple of days ago for Sunday Brunch. We had such a great experience on Christmas Day that we were curious about trying out their Sunday brunch. We called ahead to make sure there was availability and they told us we were welcome to walk in. We arrived around 11:30am and seated fairly quickly in a nice cozy booth. The restaurant was only half full, there were a few large groups of at least 5-8 people. A few tables had reserved signs placed on them - great choice since they were by the windows. By 12pm there were no empty tables.  I wasn't sure what to expect for their Sunday Brunch because i was really surprised at the price. Normally buffet brunches range from $40-50 (double that downtown at some buffets). It was priced at $29.99!! This is what they offered: bacon wrapped filet mignon, duck breast, pork tenderloin, prime rib, tilapia, salmon, rice, veggies, roasted potatoes pasta, king crab legs, peel & eat shrimp, full antipasto selection of cheeses, cold cuts, seafood salad etc., Breakfast items were eggs benedict, made to order omelette station, made to order pancakes, bacon, sausage. For dessert there was a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit, mini mousses, cakes, pies - the list goes on! Pretty impressive for $29.99! Ooops almost forgot - coffee & orange juice were included in the price. I'm a big coffee drinker and love a good cup of coffee Their coffee was really good, which surprised me since i never like hotel coffee. 2-3 different servers came by to clear plates, top up coffee, water and anything else we needed. We never had to flag anyone down. I also had an allergy concern and they brought out the sous chef to go over a couple of the items with me (they did the same at Christmas Day brunch).    On a side note - Christmas Day brunch costs only $5-$10 more and has double the amount of items as well as turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and options for kids. Plus they have cookie decorating & a visit from Santa for the kids.  I took away 1 star for 2 reasons. #1 they didn't have any options for kids. Chicken tenders, fries or mini pizzas would be nice especially since they are offered at their holiday brunches. and a couple of items were cold. #2 a couple of items were a bit cold.  Overall - great experience, friendly staff and we were treated very well - i will definitely be back!",1,1
"Another delicious meal from Bruno's in Peoria.  Not a fancy place, but the owners do a great job.  Thank you Ben and Leila, we appreciate you - and look forward to returning for another great meal in the near future!",1,1
Another Yelp success story!  I've been looking for a neighborhood pizza and wings place and finally found it!  I'm very particular about my wings and happy that they measure up!  The pizza is great too and the antipasto salad is just right.  Add delivery and Bruno's saves me from cooking dinner!,1,1
10/10 everything. There's isn't one item that isn't amazing. Sends my taste buds in a journey every time I eat anything from Bruno's,1,1
great food loved going here the staff will talk and laugh with you not too bad prices,1,1
One of my favorite pizza places in town. The Sicilian pizza is the best. It can feed my gf and I for 3-4 meals. I highly suggest it if you like a thick crusted pizza,1,1
"Can you say AMAZING!!! Twice baked Sicilian pizza, delicious wings, and great staff. You know those places that feel like everybody knows your name? The owner was THAT welcoming. I have a feeling this is my next home when it comes to pizza and wings.",1,1
The calzone special was wonderful. Best I have ever had. The sausage was flavorful with the sauce and the melted cheese really made the combo. Fresh and tasty. I had to come back for more so now I am trying their homemade lasagna. You have to try this place. You won't be disappointed.,1,1
I come here all the time for the lunch special 2 slices and a drink for $3.99 this is the best pizza on my side of town.,1,1
"Oh my gosh, I am from northeast NJ, always on the hunt for good pizza, and I need to tell you guys that this place is awesome!!!!  I'm nearly certain this is the best place I've tried in the west valley, and certainly at least as good as any of the great pizza I've had at some places in Scottsdale.  On top of having exceptional pizza, the staff is unbelievably sweet and the shop is really cute!!  I think it would be a really cozy place to dine in, while staying casual.  I definitely can't wait to come here again, and I would recommend this place to anybody!",1,1
"Been here a few times and the pizza is fresh every time, the employee is very nice which for me is very important when eating somewhere. Nice that there are 2 tv's on different channels, best thing is I live in walking distance.",1,1
We are pizza freaks and we love this place. Yay small businesses! Always do pick up though.,1,1
Love this place!! Me and my boyfriend come here often and they always remember us and are so welcoming and friendly! They have amazing food definitely the best wings I've ever had! :),1,1
"This place is small yet comfortable for my nephew and I. Felt like we were at home watching the suns game and eating pizza.  The owner was so nice. I had asked him politely if she could put on this end game, instead. She handed me the remote control like I was family. Haha. She said whatever you need let me know.  Thumbs up.  I ordered the ziti mushroom pasta, Holy cow they put way too much sauce in!!! Which was PERFECT!!! :)) it also came with a house salad and breadsticks. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the vegetarian pizza. But either way, the pizza was fantastic :) minus rhe olives. .. ( I said no olives) :/   We'll be coming back. :))",1,1
Good pizza and superior cheese. Great value especially the lunch special. I love their steak and mushroom sandwich and think their wings are a cut above. Nice owners. Love to sit and talk as they are Big soccer fans.,1,1
Amazing pizza. Its so hard to find places with such fresh toppings. And that serves you with Glass dishes and real silverware! The workers were so nice also. I had no idea i lived this close to such a great pizza shop. I will definitely  come back. And highly recommend it!,1,1
"I am from New York so you know I am super picky about food and my 300 pound stature lets you know I enjoy my food when I get it. So when I say this place is like home, you know this will be food legends are made from. IMHO it does not matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal like no other before. Priced right & they deliver!",1,1
"Best pizza on the west side!! Wings are great too, can't wait to come back and try all the different items on the menu.",1,1
My wife and I ordered a Cheese Pizza with a side of mild wings. The crust is crispy and everything is delicious. Nice alternative to a pizza chain. We will without a doubt will be back and recommend it to anyone in the area.,1,1
Salad was really great antipasto. Very fresh and lots of meat and cheese. Pizza was loaded with toppings. Chicken parm was a nice way to round out our dinner. First time here and won't be the last. Staff all said hi and seemed very interested in making sure I had a good night. Carried out. I am saving that last star for my dine in experience.,1,1
"We got 2 xlg cheese pizzas, we went and got them and the pizza was the best I've had here since moving to az.  The dough was awesome and the pizza was even better cold. I love cold pizza. So over all it was a very good place totally recommend trying.",1,1
"We have been going to Dr. Lee for several years now.  There are several things I like about Dr. Lee.  Not only does he have a kind and professional demeanor, but he never tries to upsell or recommend services that you don't need.  He uses the latest equipment and his staff is super friendly.  If you are looking for a highly skilled dentist who is interested in the patient and not trying to just make an extra buck, I would recommend Accurate Dental Care.",1,1
"I have been going to Dr Lee since he took over the business from a previous dentist. He is absolutely wonderful! He takes the time to get to know his patient and know you by name, which is a great feeling. I have had different issues in the past with my teeth, but he is very knowledgeable and has solved the issues. He worked with me through a cavity, and knew when it was time to go to a specialist (endodontist). I have had to get wisdom teeth pulled and he was able to perform the procedure in the office. It was quick and painless. I highly recommend him!",1,1
"I have been to Dr Lee's practice twice, both appointments were very pleasant.  I was greeted with enthusiasm and I was ushered back to see the dentist at more appointed time.  Having worked in dental offices most of my life, I am very alert to anything amiss or not clean.  I am very pleased with this office,  they are gentle, kind and the office is soothing.  I highly  recommend Accurate Dental Care.",1,1
I have been seeing Dr. Mike Lee for a few years now. He is very friendly and highly skilled. He has up to date instruments and is very quick but thorough. It took him 10 minutes to clean my teeth with his machine. His dental hygienist was definitely experienced.   I am tired of being poked and prodded by instruments or nearly choking on things that should not be set in my mouth as storage. That has not happened to me with Dr. Mike. His wife also works at this same practice.,1,1
"Went there for the first time with a group of twelve, I explained to our waitress that I had a prior engagement and needed to served quickly. Tina said they could do it,  I was surprized our order came on time the burger was first class the beer was cold the place was clean our bill came fast I was happy and will be back with our group next monday, Hope tina is the waitress she friendly and efficent even if there are no free beers Dan.",1,1
"When the bartender knows the name of all their customers and what they drink the minute they walk in the door you know you're in one of those good  neighborhood bars. We found the wait staff very friendly to us although we were not regulars , the cheese burgers were very good and the beer was cold what more can you ask for.",1,1
Decent place.service could be better.will give it another try sometime.my husband really liked his chz burger,1,1
Great food.  We eat there on a regular basis. I usually get their burger and it's good every time. Service is quick and friendly.,1,1
"Great dive bar. Spacious. Lots of locals. Our waitress was slow and not knowledgeable but she was nice. I am actually closer to a 4.5 on this one. Food was good, hearty.",1,1
"The BEST all-you-can-eat fish fry. Every order came out freshly cooked unlike other restaurants that cook ahead. Some of the other people at our table ordered other meals and they were delicious, filling, and worth the price. The waitress, Misty, was awesome. We never went without a drink refill or more fish and she even laughed at our horrible jokes. Come early because there was a line outside the door and for good reason.",1,1
The place was very fun and I wish we had time for either a concert or to bowl. We just a bite to eat and beer. I had to go with their famous fried chicken which didn't disappoint!,1,1
"This review is only for the Fried Chicken.  If you even remotely like Fried  Chicken, you will love the Fried Chicken here.  There is nothing else like it, light, crispy, tasty, and juicy.  Best Fried Chicken I have ever eaten, ever!",1,1
"I have yet to eat here but it's one of my goals! I have been to a few shows here and I absolutely love the venue, it's one of my new favorites! It's easier to get to and parking is way better than HOB, The Joint, Etc. I'll update the review after I try the restaurant too! But until then please keep up the great work and awesome shows that are coming to this location.",1,1
"This review is for the food.  It's been about 2 years since I was last at Brooklyn Bowl. The last few times I tried going, they had a private party and canceled my reservations.  I had given up going here but I gave this place one more try on this visit.  Hurrah! I got in!  The place is actually a music venue and an upscale bowling place. They do have a bar and a restaurant, but they focus more on their music scene.  For this visit, they closed their restaurant side of the place, and had diners go to the bar to eat.  The bar area is small, and I had to wait for a lower table. It wasn't really the fault of the staff, as they claim diners took over 2 hours to eat, hogging up the tables.  The menu is simple, and has everything from burgers to sandwiches, but their signature item is their matzo fried chicken. The chicken, however, isn't cheap, but so darn good!  Stephen and I shared a 1/2 chicken dinner (mixed portion with mashed potatoes and collard greens) and an order of their Rock. And Roll. Fries which is similar to poutine, where the fries are mixed with cheese and topped with hot gravy.  Ask for extra gravy!!  The food didn't look like a lot, but we barely finished the 2 dishes.  We left so full!   I forgot how delicious the fried chicken was, and it was worth the 2 year wait.  I will definitely come back again.",1,1
"I've been to Brooklyn Bowl a number of times now for random reasons: meeting friends for a drink, rockstar karaoke, see a concert, but it wasn't until my last time here that I really thought of it as a cool place to hang out.  My friends and I met up to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. We ordered the fried chicken and drank wine. LOL. The food and drinks were great, as was our server who was server attentive and never kept us waiting, but I also really loved the ambiance. There was a concert there that night so people were constantly coming in and out. It was just a very a lively and fun atmosphere.",1,1
Love the live music and their fried chicken! Best of both worlds! Can't wait to go back in April for a concert!! Eek!,1,1
"This place is amazing! Awesome food, Great beer, and on some night a really amazing concert venue. They're also happens to be some really cool high end bowing, if you're interested. Highly suggest coming here. It's one of our favorite spots. If you eat, you MUST get the fried chicken & the hummus. So good!",1,1
"I had been to Brooklyn Bowl before to drink some beer during their happy hour, but I had yet to catch a show there. I happened to win tickets to Flight Facilities... now was the time.   Man! What a show! I really dig this venue! There is seriously a bowling alley right alongside the performance space. I love it! The beer costs are a little steep ($6 PBR) but it's the strip...so when you compare it to the surroundings, it's not so bad.   The set up is pretty easy to navigate, though I can see this place becoming a can of sardines for sold out shows. There are many options to get booze and an outdoor area to take a breather, which I appreciate. Their beer selection isn't half bad and their mixed drink prices weren't too horrible either. For happy hour, the prices were good (about $4/beer) and the window view was fun to people watch.  Once you walk in (from the Linq Promenade) head up the escalators and go straight back (for concerts or dining) or make a quick right (for happy hour). It's as simple as that!  I will update this review once I get a chance to actually bowl here.",1,1
"They've captured the highlights of Brooklyn with this venue. It also seems like the corrected the flaws of local venues to produce one helluva place to catch a show. Awesome set up, TV's are everywhere so you don't miss a thing. Only complaint is the line at the main bar moves a bit slow. I always wish venues would offer a beer line only, but they never do...  We saw Soja, it was a Tuesday night show, but the floor filled quickly after the opening act. We saw the opportunity for our group to upgrade to the VIP booths upstairs when we noticed availability prior to show time. We negotiated a fair price (if we didn't meet our food/beverage minimum, we could've moved to the bowling lanes after the show until we met it - I thought that was nice); got our bracelets and took over booth and then bellied up to rail once Soja took the stage. Service was attentive. We couldn't get enough of the Drunken Palmers. Great show, venue and good time!",1,1
"Really cool venue for smaller shows. Saw Chance the Rapper and think it might of been too small for someone like him but was still an a great show....they had lighting issues which delayed the show a bit. I also saw Chief Keef here and it was a good time as well. Never ate here or been bowling but it's definitely a unique place. One downside for some attending shows here is that it's all pretty much General Admission (standing room), even the VIP areas is standing room.",1,1
Fun place for adults. Good bar specials and good service. Can't imagine that I would want to come here with kids - more with the big kids! It is a fun place for adults to have a good time.,1,1
"Service was solid. Our waiter (Asian guy who used to work at the Bellagio) was one of the best I have had in the city. He was attentive and made sure my daughter was having fun which is 99% of the battle in a dining experience out with a 4 yr old. The fried chicken was amazing. Also, the mashed potatoes and gravy was great as well as the collared  greens. They were the best I have ever had at a restaurant.   Great addition to the strip. Good job!",1,1
"Awesome venue, but it is on the Strip, so be prepared to pregame. I've seen several great shows there. They seem to bring in great bands all the time.",1,1
"Had a great time here watching the Smashing Pumpkins. The venue may not be ideal for watching a concert due to some challenging sight lines.  However, we managed to have a great time... Until we got asked to leave for doing head stands.  Namaste.",1,1
"What an awesome addition to Vegas. Vegas really has nothing like this and I'm sure glad we do now. Charm C. had invited me to come here because there was a band performing and apparently you can eat and watch without having to buy a ticket. Awesome! Very fun experience I must say and the food and service were great as well. Charm C. and I shared the fried chicken dinner. Boy it was pretty good, although maybe not the best fried chicken I've ever had I certainly wouldn't mind ordering it again the next time I'm here. We also had fries and cucumbers as our sides. Fries were pretty standard shoestring fries since they were light and crisp and the cucumbers were mixed with red onion drizzled with vinegar. I really liked the fact we ordered cucumbers as second side since it was nice fresh bite between the fried food. Joanne our server was really awesome! Constantly checked up on us without being annoying, which tends to happen when you feel like your server is hoovering over you. She was also pretty personable, which can be kinda hard to carry a conversation with customers since the music is so loud, but yet she still did it! We tried eating slow so we could finish watching the concert, but it just came down to asking Joanne if it was okay to stay at our booth even if we were finished eating. She said that was fine and we ""paid"" for these seats. Wow, what an awesome answer, more brownie points for her! We finish our meal with the bread pudding and it was pretty good. If I had known they drizzle chocolate on top I would of asked for no chocolate because I am not a chocolate fan but it was still good none the less. I will definitely be coming here again next time there is a artist/band I like and will bring more friends with me!",1,1
"I had to come to Brooklyn Bowl for late lunch. I had a choice to eat at the bar or restaurant so I chose at the bar. The bar was empty w/ plenty of tables and tv's. My waiter, Anthony was friendly and suggested the fried chicken or jimmy Hendrix pancakes. He was very good on refills of water and soda. I heard they make the best fried chicken in Vegas. The reviews on yelp is so true about the fried chicken. I ordered half dark chicken dinner w/collard greens and mash potatoes. The fried chicken pieces come in 4 pieces w/ juicy and crispy. The collard greens taste like from the South along with the delicious mash potatoes and gravy. My husband ordered jimmy Hendrix pancakes and 3 chicken wings. He loved it! Anyway, great place to eat or bowl or drink or hang out.",1,1
"""Welcome to the land of hire ""I hope you brought the right attire, ""The crippled man is waiting at the door""  --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------  Quick Review™: Booking the best artists today out of all other venues in the valley.  No major faults or areas of weakness.  Best chicken.   --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------  Alright. At the door will be an able-bodied jester imploring passers-by to come on in to the ""World Famous Brooklyn Bowl."" Honestly, I've been to Brooklyn, NY for shows and had never insomuch as heard of Brooklyn Bowl until it opened the outpost (BBLV) here in Las Vegas. In any case, their jesters are entertaining, as is requisite in their job description.   The box -- both regular (which is outside) and will call/guest list (inside) -- are staffed by competent and friendly professionals. And, that shall be a recurring theme with BBLV: nearly every area has the utmost professional staff in terms of hospitality for a music venue. Only other venue that even comes to mind that surpasses is MSG and every one knows that the Garden just happens to be the Platinum Standard when it comes to professionals.   --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------  Once inside -- whether grasping a ticket or otherwise* -- you should have three choices on any given night: bowl, eat, or listen to live music. If Jack White or My Morning Jacket are playing, you won't be bowling, you jerkface. You really shouldn't bowl if anyone is performing, out of respect, however, you purchased the lane so do whatever the hell you want. Lanes during shows vary depending on the artist. It's not really my thing to do; however, I have had a lane during a show and we simply left it abandoned with purses from our party when the artist went on.   *There are unticketed, free shows every once in a while.  Pro Tip: The security won't watch your lane even if you have the first two ones which are located right next to where he is posted. No biggie.   Like most venues of its size -- think the original The Joint or House of Blues -- there is the wood floor pit and an elevated second level that surrounds the floor area where there are bars and vertically challenged concert-goers. Additionally, this may be the spot for you that simply wishes not to be jostled about in the mosh pit, if at a show where one develops. Beware of the chatty people who attend shows every so often to have the live music serve as background to their philistine conversations about nothing.   Pro Tip: Wear hearing protection. The good kind cuts off the highs (most harmful), thus silencing the talkers, and making the music sound better as well.   Unlike other venues of its size, they are actually booking artists who simply would not stop in Vegas if it were not for BBLV, or do so a lot less often. I can't think of a time when MMJ would've stopped in Vegas and I wouldn't fathom a two-night stint from the badass rockers if it were not for BBLV.    Pro Tip: My Morning Jacket's two sets in two nights was shekel for shekel the best several hours of music in years in this valley. One has to go back to Leonard Cohen's seven hours at Colosseum or the B/S eight-set mini residencies to capture that magic. If you don't know what I am talking (writing) about, you need to get out more.  --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------  I won't expound too much on bowling (who cares?) or the food (probably ... nay: for sure the best out of any music venue) because who comes to a concert venue for that? The bowling is bowling. The fried chicken is phenomenal. I don't remember which dessert I got but that was probably on account of all the cannabis smoke in the air during The Wailers.  Pro Tip: They are not lenient when it comes to smoking in here. Security will take it for ""safekeeping."" Burning Man this is not.   Lastly, they might have the best house photographer on Earth with the handiwork of the versatile Erik Kabik behind the 1D X.  --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------  Rating: Five-stars, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""",1,1
"Try the Sloppy Joe's.  What was I eating before?  Manwich.  I will throw out that can in my cabinets.  After having the sandwich over Memorial Day weekend, I was inspired to make my own. It was okay.  I can't wait to go to Vegas again so that I can eat here again.   Everything else:  We arrived as they opened on Saturday so there was no crowd.  There were people waiting in line but they were waiting for the box office.  We were seated outside and the weather was fabulous.  I will definitely visit this place again.",1,1
"One of my fave places to hang out whether its listening to live music, having a few drinks or eating. LOVE!! Their fried chicken, egg shooters, smoked chicken wings and mac and cheese! Wish their salad selection was better but I don't mind because the chicken and mac and cheese makes up for it! The staff are also cool there, however, I think they need more servers to assist the restaurant because the wait to order could be an issue. I've already seen a handful of artist perform here at the Vegas Brooklyn Bowl (The Roots, The Green, Robert Randolph and most recently Lauren Hill) and hope to see more awesome artist on their upcoming line up. I'm definitely a fan! :)",1,1
"Such a great venue that includes 16 bowling lanes, a restaurant, a stage with dance floor & plenty of bars to keep you hydrated.   Bowling is $60 a hour for a lane & shoe rentals for up to 8 people. Be sure to try to snag an lane on the second floor because it comes with your own private box on the balcony that overlooks the stage & dance floor! Really is the best seat in the house.   Food is phenomenal as well. I personally loved the french bread pizza, corn on the cob & the alcoholic milkshake. DO NOT leave without tasting the milkshake! Literally the best milkshake I have ever had.   I have already bought tickets to come back for another show!",1,1
"The Roots, Lauryn Hill, Disclosure, Local Natives, Flume, Chance, Bonobo... these are some of the artists that Brooklyn Bowl has or will welcome with open arms.   With that being said, this place is amazing!! Diverse genres of music and an awesome venue. Go up an escalator and you're where the magic happens. Do you like to bowl, eat, and listen to music while drunk? Then this is your place. Gotta add, ordered a vodka redbull and they did not hold back on the alcohol. Brooklyn beers also available on tap.  The restaurant serves some good fried chicken from Blue Ribbon. Add some of their hot sauce or soak that ish' in honey and your set. Their fries with cheese and gravy are worth trying too but attack it immediately and eat it when hot. You can even pass on eating inside the restaurant and sit at their outdoor area overlooking Sprinkles and the High Roller. Asked our server it it'd be possible to eat at the restaurant during performance nights, she inquired, and said that it shouldn't be a problem. 21+ after 8p.  Honestly, this is probably one of the coolest venues I've been to. Good job, Vegas!",1,1
"Been looking forward to see a show here since it opened.  Saw the Avett Brothers recently and Brooklyn Bowl did not disappoint. I've been to many concerts in Vegas and this is my new favorite venue. Very intimate setting, great acoustics, very inexpensive drinks (cheapest I've seen on the strip) and no waiting for drinks or bathroom.   Looking forward to seeing more shows here. Helpful hint the Linq has its own valet parking with easy access to the venue",1,1
"I really liked Brooklyn Bowl.  I came to see Warren G and DJ Quick perform. When I first arrived there were two lines. A line for those who had already purchased tickets and a line for those who still needed to purchase. Both lines looked long but we were inside the venue in a matter of minutes. Security checks your ID before they let you into the doors. Once you reach the doors, there is more security, they pat you down, wave their little wands, check your purse,  put  a wristband on you, and you're good to go.   It never took long to get a drink at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly. When you are down on the floor, there's a bartender with a cash register to the left hand side so you can order drinks directly from there instead of having to go back to the bar. Beer prices weren't too bad ($8).   My tickets were GA standing so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to see amongst the crowd since I'm 5'3. I didn't have any problems at all. I was able to see all of the performers perfectly and they put on an amazing show. I was only expecting to see Warren G and DJ Quick, but Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger made a special appearance and performed as well. The show made this west coast girl miss home.  I had a really good experience so I wouldn't mind driving down to the strip (which is something I hate doing) to see another show.",1,1
"This is a great event venue and bowling place. We went to a concert there and had a wonderful time. We had no idea we could rent a bowling lane and watch the concert at the same time. The bowling lanes are to the side of the concert area and have screens showing the concert stage performance at all times. It was wonderful. Standing room only for concerts, which can be difficult for older people but it was great just the same. The parking was confusing at first but available. I highly recommend this place.",1,1
Best new venue in the west!!!! Huge room.  Great sound.  Satisfying food.  Pleasant staff.   Can't wait to go back!  Well worthwhile the 4+ hour drive from LA.,1,1
"Went to the Brooklyn Bowl for the first time Friday night to see Steve Winwood perform.A nice intimate venue, not crazy like some music venues get.They really should set up seating on the main stage floor.There is also a bowling venue adjacent so you could hear the band play and watch it on screens that sat above the lanes.You can eat, drink and have a great time at the Brooklyn Bowl.Oh...Steve Winwood was awesome!",1,1
Really fun place!! Great wait staff. Great food. Drinks are weak and over priced. That's my only complaint. You can listen to the concerts while eating without paying the admission fee.,1,1
Best calamari on the strip! Excellent service from the bartenders at the bar! The happy hour deals are awesome!!!,1,1
"So fun! What a cool environment to celebrate a birthday party, adult style! There are several different bars inside so you're not waiting forever for a drink, they have a great sound system, clean bathrooms with attendants, and located in the heart of the Linq.",1,1
Great place to see your favorite rock artist. I have been to many places where venues do not allow you to mosh and rock hard to the music. This place is definitely not one of them. People and the vibe on the dance floor just what it needs to be for all rock shows. I also give it up to the staff for at least giving you a warning before getting kicked out. Got my warning after crowd surfing after multiple times. :) Most venues just eject you with no warning for swarming on the dance floor...... (HOBlues) will be back!,1,1
"Went there for the Elvis Costello and The Roots concert! What a venue! Had dinner on the patio over looking 16 Block, Hospitality and The High Roller, nice view! Fried Chicken and wings were good.  They serve honey to put on the fried chicken.  The blowling alley has double decker lanes, thought that was super awesome! And at the same time the concert area was jumping! Bars all over, lounge in front is the Bomb! I will be back!",1,1
"Great concert Venue. Saw Meshuggah on Thursday October 19th - it was very enjoyable. Great sound, great floor, fun crowd. And the food was great too. Had some fried chicken and deep fried pickles during the opener. Was surprised by the pickles - they weren't like others I've had before they were like pickle strings. Yummy! I would recommend this place to watch your band and also to eat. Great job!",1,1
"This is not your Gold Coast's bowling. This is a little slice of hipster Brooklyn, right off the strip in a little spot that feels like LA. So confusing.  If you like bowling, you don't need to read any further. If you don't like bowling, here's why you'll like Brooklyn Bowl:  -Cracked leather couches for max relaxing is greater than hard plastic chairs -Disco ball and ambient lighting is greater than fluorescent lighting  -Exposed brick walls are greater than weird murals from the 70s -Live entertainment and Top 40 hits are greater than a jukebox with hairbands -Food from Blue Ribbon is SO MUCH GREATER THAN defrosted mozz sticks and bagged wings -Craft beer and frozen margaritas are greater than cans of Coors  This is a place for when you want to go out with friends for a good time and do something slightly amped up, but isn't gambling or the Rhino and doesn't require fancy clothes.  So, so, so fun.",1,1
"Great value for your money in Vegas. Great location, close to the LINQ and High Roller. Went for happy hour and got a pitcher of Mojitos - they were delicious and a great value. Hummus is delicious. Portions are large and its great BBQ and comfort food. There are also vegetarian options. The rock and roll fries were great. Fun atmosphere. Also have bowling and bands/slideshows. Over all a friendly staff, great food, perfect location, and moderate pricing.",1,1
"This review is for the Brooklyn Bowl's concert venue only. I've been to a dozen shows here and I love it! The acoustics aren't the best, but the space is top-notch. It's standing room only, but there's plenty of room on the large wooden floor to rock out and bounce to the music. If you get tired of the crowds, you can move back into an open bar area with very limited seating. If you're a high roller, you can reserve one of the bowling lanes for the duration of the live performance (but it'll cost you a pretty penny). The best feature of the venue is the large outdoor deck where you can catch some fresh air or leave for a smoke. I also LOVE that there are televisions all around that broadcast the show live so you never miss a minute. Good security and great sight lines make this music venue a-ok in my book.",1,1
"The brand new ""Brooklyn Bowl"" in the new ""Linq"" area of Vegas (behind Harrah's) is both amazing and a disappointment:  Food - 5 stars. Some of the menu options are ridiculously pricey, ie: 8 pieces of honey fried chicken for $24, but the daily specials are amazing. $10 for a HUMONGOUS fried chicken sandwich with fries. The fried chicken was perfect, with honey drizzle and hot sauce. Perfection! The brisket with southern slaw and collared greens was delish.  Drinks - pricey. Maybe $2 too pricey with $12-15 drinks for a non-club.  Service - 5 stars all the staff is really attentive.  Marketing - 1 star. This is where it fails. From the outside half the people I asked said it looked like a bowling alley, the other half said a small concert venue. Both are correct. It's so hard to see inside that you don't realize how gigantic it is inside with multiple floors, awesome decor and tons of room, indoor and outdoor patios, to roam and explore.  Give it a shot and tell their staff to work on marketing it from the outside. It's worth it once they come in.",1,1
"So much to do at this place. I went to a concert here once, for 21 Pilots, tickets vary per show but this one was about $20 and they are all general admission standing. In the same area there is a bowling alley. Last time i checked they were charging $30 for 30 minutes, but it was during a concert so i don't know if it would be less when there is no concert going on.   There is also a restaurant inside. They have the best fried chicken I've ever tried. The seasoning is just perfect and the chicken is so moist. You can either get a half chicken and choose all dark meat, all white meat, or a mix. And they can also do larger portions for big parties. My friend had a NY Steak which was huge and so very moist as well.   They are usually open late around 2 am, great place do get a drink, and I've noticed guys think its a pretty cool spot.",1,1
"This review update is for the restaurant. While the venue is still cool and has a nice vibe, the restaurant offers nothing else than average American bar food. Our table tried the PIZZA ON FRENCH BREAD which tasted okay, although I didn't expect a baguette with toppings when they say ""french bread"". The CAESARS SALAD was crunchy but the CORN on the side was cold. It was corrected though quickly by the attentive staff.  The bar looks well equipped but you have to stick to their 4 house cocktails, no extra wishes allowed. The MOJITO W/ EXTRA SHOT was delicious though.",1,1
"I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit Brooklyn Bowl not once, but twice in one week and let me tell you, I couldn't WAIT to write this review.  Instead of writing a review the first time, I waited for two visits, so I could write a really well balanced review. I thought the first time was too good to be true. Man, I'm glad I waited...  FINALLY, a REALLY great space on the strip.  As a local, I try to stay away from the strip as it's too congested and inconvenient for the everyday life.  This place, will absolutely bring me back time and time again.  When you approach ""The BB,"" you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing olden day-type cinema sign.  From the outside, it doesn't look that big, but don't let that fool you!  Once you enter, you'll make your way up the escalators.  To the right is a little bar, high top table seating area.  This area is full of large windows which offers great views of the Linq.  To the left of the concierge desk are the restrooms and a couple of ATM machines.  Pass the desk and there's either an outdoor space with table tops and a smoking section to the right, and a lovely restaurant with another bar!  Then, the good stuff:  Passed all that, is a HUGE concert venue area and 16 lanes of bowling.  WOW!  Don't worry, there's a few more bars to keep you liquored up all night long.  If that's not enough, make your way to top VIP area where there's lots of balcony space for the concert, sofas for seating and 16 more lanes to bowl on!  In the VIP area, there's also a bar, an outside roof deck and even a very eclectic living room which offers comfortable couches, big screen tvs, quirky signs and lights, all encompassed with a quieter atmosphere.  SOOO AWESOME!!!    Brooklyn Bowl is full of amazing features. All around, there's leather couches, palm trees, artsy signs, vines covering the walls and lots of exposed brick. Shows lots of character. The staff is also on point!  They are nice, attentive and EVERYWHERE.  All I have to say is the staffing department did an amazing job!  (There's your shout out, Java!) In all seriousness, one of my former coworker left our company to work at this place and I'm glad she did.  I'm absolutely amazed!  On my first visit, our server was Michael, who goes by Micah.  He was AH-MAZE-ING.  So accommodating, so nice and personable, so awesome. I firmly believe the overall experience comes from the tone a server sets and The BB is filled with positive servers and bartenders.    I'm not going to lie, the drinks aren't cheap.  I payed about $12 for my Ketel One vodka and soda water.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  You're on the strip.  If you're going to come here, make sure you can afford it.  If not, I think Southpoint has bowling and dollar drinks LOL.  I don't mind it at all, because I don't do this very often.  On both visits, I also had the awesome opportunity to try their food for free.  Here's what I had and here's what I thought:  BBQ pork sliders with cole slaw:  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The cole slaw added a crunchy texture and sweet taste.  The bun was good, maybe too thick, but didn't hurt the experience.  The San Gennaro Pizza:  VERY GOOD pizza.  It's filled with sausage, mozzarella and pepper.  This pizza is packed with sausage!  Lots of toppings offered NO complaints LOL.   Chicken wings:  THE BEST THING THEY HAVE, BY FAR!  The batter was crispy and crunchy and light.  It was so flavorful with spices and not overpowering. It was served with honey which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It really just takes the wings to the next level.  So delicious.  Rolling Stone really hit home when they said Brooklyn Bowl is ""one of the most incredible places on earth.""  I really believe that on a Las Vegas strip perspective.  Who would have thought a venue that offers bowling and live music in one place would be such a hit!  This is exactly what Vegas needed.  Opening up with one of the coolest bands, The Roots, was a great move on their part.  Listen, if you're in the area, turn north on Koval and make a turn into Winnick street.  You need to park your car and walk to Brooklyn Bowl.  This place will blow you away.  Trust me, it's simply AH-MAZE-ING!",1,1
"Freaking fantastic ambiance! Such a fun, rustic venue. We saw a show last Saturday night and it didn't disappoint. They could use a few more tables around the bowling check in center but other than that, this is a really sweet new spot in Vegas. We are planning to check out the lineup next year and visit when a favorite artist rolls in to town. Highly recommend stopping by this place for a drink, bowling or food. The menu looked great.",1,1
"What an awesome venue! Phil and friends rocked it as usual. Looking forward to another show tonight.  Lighting, sound, and layout were spot on.",1,1
"Love this place. Good food and drinks. Service is always great. Amazing venue for live music. Seen several acts here and never disappoints. Haven't tried the bowling yet, looks fun!",1,1
"Service was only 2 or 3 stars, but food was 5. I ordered the French bread pizza and my boyfriend ordered a chicken dinner. Both were amazing. Service was very slow and it wasn't even busy. Food was pricey, but expected. Really cool venue and atmosphere.",1,1
"Great venue for music, food, oh and bowling..try the fried chicken at the restaurant! The batter is so good and chicken so tender. lots of room and places to hang out in there (indoor and outdoor seating).",1,1
Restaurant was ridiculously overpriced even for the strip. Then you go to concert and beer is cheaper?! Haha okay. Acoustics are great! Second time going and it was actually an improvement. I saw the Green the first time and Katchafire this time. Overall it's worth going.,1,1
"First, I am going to give this a non-food review (the food would probably get three or four stars) because this is really more of an entertainment and drink spot. Brooklyn bowl is great for concerts! I have seen three shows here and been impressed each time. The venue is not that big, but big enough to host hundreds of fans. The drinks are a bit pricey, but exactly what you expect for this type of place and the quality is there. The sound quality is awesome, which is really one of the most important things. Also, there really is no bad place to see the stage, unless you are standing behind a basketball team. The staff is on top of everything as well. I also was there for my fiance's after work bowling event and while I did not bowl, the event seemed to go well after everyone arrived and the food came.",1,1
Not much to say other than the FREID CHICKEN with honey and hot sauce. No questions just order it!,1,1
"I've never had a bad meal here. The hummus is very tasty- especially the cilantro jalapeño. The major bummer is that the large hummus appetizer gives you this huge serving of hummus and only two pieces of pita. If you want more pita- you have to pay!  Imagine having a large group; this can add up very quickly.  The kids meals offer tasty and healthy choices and are a good value.  My favs are the chicken schwarma sandwich, the red quinoa salad, the mahi mahi and the Mediterranean Chicken salad.",1,1
"Mmmmm... good food, great service, fair prices.  It is the whole package for us! Love going there for the fresh salads and yummy warm pita sandwiches.",1,1
"Busy, but the server tried very hard to keep all tables happy.  Food was good as always. like the old lemonade blend better, though!",1,1
"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though.",1,1
I love everything at this place! I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here.. I love the cilantro jalapeno hummus; it is now the ONLY hummus I eat. Nothing else compares.,1,1
"Always great food and I really like the atmosphere.  Last night I had special appetizer Seared Ahi Tuna with Hummus.  The tuna was really tasty, with a slight hint of spice in the marinade. And I also had a bowl of their very consistent and delicious gazpacho soup.  I think it's only there in the summer, but I can't remember.  It is so yummy.  And a side of cucumbers which was worth the 99 cents for the amount they give.  Waitress lady was great, she and the waiter guy kept my iced tea full throughout, and I was really thirsty, so it was nice not having to ask for a refill.  Pita Jungle is always good, and it seems really healthy. :o)",1,1
"I am reviewing this Arcadia Pita Jungle while anticipating the newest location opening downtown at 3rd and Roosevelt by Lola Coffee sometime very soon I hear.  But also b/c I just ate at PJ today for lunch and realized I have never yelped it, how odd.  I like it, I don't LOOOOVE it like some people do and that's okay--- considering, I have only had salads here it's hard to really fall in love with a place when all you've had are salads.  The wraps and other items on the menus look delish, I really need to branch out more.  Today's menu was the salmon salad, it was really good and really big, glad I ordered it b/c I was hungry.   My only complaint is that it took really long for the bill to get to our table which normally doesn't bother me but when you need to hurry back to work, it can be annoying.  The staff are friendly, I was thrown back by our server though b/c she was dressed like heading out to a brunch with her gal pals and was wearing a fedora so when she walked up to our table and asked what we wanted to drink,  I was hesitant to tell her b/c I thought she was just a nosy diner.  haha.  All in all, I'm a fan.   Seating is a bit tight, but not to worry if you go before noon.  The minute we sat down at 11:55, there was a line forming out the door for a table.",1,1
"My favorite place to eat hands down. My favorite items are - broiled chicken salad (sometimes I use my own homemade ranch) this salad is the best. The jalapeño hummus is so good. The pesto flatbread with chicken is amazing. The fruit Fantasia is so good and so much fruit and cheese comes with it for the price. The chicken deal sol, black bean burger and chicken philly are sooo good!! And the nachos are amazing!",1,1
"My biggest complaint about Pita Jungle is its name, which makes the place sound more like a fast-food Mediterranean joint like Extreme Pita than an upscale, healthy restaurant. In fact, even though I've worked nearby for over three months now and driven by countless times, I've avoided going there because I didn't know it was the kind of place it is. Of course, I know now, but I think the name was a poor choice for communicating what the restaurant's all about.   Anyway, that little naming issue aside, Pita Jungle is a great choice for a time when you'd like to have a sit-down lunch or dinner but pay reasonable prices that are more reflective of a faster dining option. Additionally, the portions are very large for the price. I went with a co-worker, and our two dishes and two sodas came out to less than $20 total. While none of the menu choices seemed mind-blowingly creative to me, my co-workers swears by the black bean burger and I thought my falafel pita was light and flavorful (and a steal at only $5.25!).   Now that I know that Pita Jungle is a restaurant serving fresh and healthy food, I have a feeling I'll be back pretty often.",1,1
"Definitely 5 stars for Pita Jungle - the food is always fresh, healthy and delicious.  Favorites? The cilantro jalapeño hummus with chicken, the Mediterranean roasted chicken shawarma (I get it wrapped in lavosh bread instead), the caramelized cauliflower appetizer, the spanakopita, and the glazed chicken pizza. And the amazing summer special in my photo - some kind of avocado tostada goodness!  They do an amazing takeout business here and always have your order ready quickly. Though it does get a bit busy and crowded around the lunch hour! #thatjustmeansitsgood  Not to mention they are open LATE! So you don't have to eat crappy fast food if you are running late on eating dinner!  For those of you with a sweet tooth like me, get the iced chai to drink or peanut butter milkshake for dessert!",1,1
"UPDATE: 2/11/17 - As you saw from the manager's comments, they got in contact me and will be providing me a free entree for my next visit. That is how customer service should be. Kevin was very prompt and helpful. I've updated my rating to 4 stars based on the excellent customer service.   ------------------ Original Review: 2/10/17 We always enjoy Pita Jungle, but on tonight's take out order the Chicken Curry Salad had no chicken. It did however have pieces of pita bread. Hopefully next time we will get the food we ordered.",1,1
"Great food and healthy for you. I had the kale salad special with red quinoa, hummus, and I added chicken. Wow, what a great lunch. I will be back",1,1
"I wish I had a Pita Jungle in my town. It's healthy, fresh, Mediterranean inspired food. The prices are on point as well. This location is smaller than others I've been to. The menu and service are consistent and don't disappoint. They have some outdoor seating too. My coworker really enjoyed his Gyro sandwich here. I love the chicken too. I also love the gelato...and in Arizona in the spring/summer gelato is always a good idea!  Please have more California locations Pita Jungle!",1,1
"Back when I did a stint as a pescetarian  (I did four months) I went to this place, it was good meaning the food.   What I didn't like was how crowded this place was and how children were just screaming from left to right. (side note: I'm a tolerant person around kids even though I have none) but this was over the top. Basically the tables were so close you actually were sitting with other people eating with them, and that made me awkward.   None the less I never went back.. but I still gave it a four star because overall the food was really good and they had a ton of good choices to choose from. :)",1,1
"Been here a few times and have tried various items on the menu from their pizzas to the hummus to their sandwiches, soups, and salads.  One definite plus is the consistency in the quality and flavor of their food.  I have yet to try anything I haven't enjoyed here.  As mentioned by other reviewers here, their portions are on the large side and if you have any dietary restrictions, they're very helpful.  The staff for the most part is friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere is usually a little on the busy side, but relaxed.  The art work on the walls rotates and tends to be a topic of conversation between my friend and myself.  One thing for sure is that if the weather is nice, I'd suggest sitting outside simply because the tables feel a little crowded indoors and if you're looking to have a private conversation, this isn't the place for you.",1,1
"My first experience at Pita Jungle was mediocre but my friends were raving about it. I just didn't get it. I had a veggie burger that wasn't too exciting. On the next few trips though I changed my mind. Try the hummus starter -- it's the best in all the land. You can't go wrong with a wrap or pita. I usually eat tackle the one thousand beans pita, which is a huge portion and you'll definitely have left overs.  Pita Jungle is always packed. Good, friendly service. Great for take out.",1,1
"I love to swing through Pita Jungle whenever possible!  Every time I come, I cannot resist ordering something with pita and hummus, and it is always roaring good! The salads, smoothies, and pitas that I've shared are all delish.  Also, there are so many non-meat and non-gluten choices. The servers are hip without being pretentious, no snakes in the grass here. The decor is king!  Come on, what a cool giant mirror!  Just writing this review makes want to get lost in the jungle again!",1,1
"I just love Pita Jungle. Honestly, it took me a while to enjoy it and explore it as much as I have over the past year. The chicken curry salad! That's it :-p  Seriously though, the chicken curry salad had me think ""this is an extremely well balanced salad with everything one could need I a meal"". Prior to finding this amazing salad I tried their spinach pasta salad, again, amazing and made me want to try all of their salads.... So that's pretty much what I have done. The carribean salad with the delicious sugar coconut shredded all over it was interesting and delicious although I was a little worried I may consume a little too much fruit for my stomach to handle. The curry soup, yum (can you tell I love curry). I used to stick to the falafel until I found out the sodium content and thought perhaps I ought to stay away from it for a while. I won't go through the menu item by item because it may take away from the surprise for you :o) So I will close by saying that the kids menu is slightly impressive compared to any other places using the myplate guidelines to ensure kids are getting a serving from every meal, they aren't spiced and just simple for the possibly picky eaters. I like it and I can't deny it and we've been eating there pretty darn regularly so I'm pretty positive we will be back.",1,1
"I have been a fan of Pita Jungle for a while but I usually have eaten at the one in Desert Ridge.  Well Hubby one day said ""hey meet me for lunch at Pita Jungle near work on Indian School""  I was like cool.  THEN he said ""you'll love this one, its way better than the one near our house"".  I gave him that skeptical look (oh you boys know which look I'm talking about...)  We went and had a great lunch and I have to tell you this place is way better.  The Jalapeno and Cilantro Hummus tastes like fresh Cilantro and has a little snap from the Jalapeno the way mother nature intended.  I love the Chicken Tikka Masala which is loaded with tender chicken in a sauce I can swim in.  My husband always orders the same thing - the Chicken Del Sol (which I am secretly envious of but refuse to order the same thing as he does.  I know I know, I'll have to get over that some day...)  I also tried the Hummus and Steak on the very last visit and have to say that this dish just rocks!  I think I could order anything here and it would be fabulous.  I love the funky Bohemian-cool atmosphere of this place too.  The servers are all really friendly and very efficient. Love this place!!!",1,1
"This location is smaller than some of the newer locations, but has great service and the same delicious food! Solid choice for any meal!",1,1
"These folks are a staple in the Phoenix area and don't really need my review. Good healthy eats in a happy hipster vibe. Super reasonably priced with an eclectic Mediterranean based menu. They've got the to-go process down to a science. *they have to-go Sriracha on the ready!!!  If you've been to any house party, BBQ, or bat mitzvah in the past decade you're probably as tired of hummus as I am. Skip it. Try the baba ganoush or the garlic dip. Super veg friendly. Love you.",1,1
"Still a fan!  This time around I tried the Chicken Hummus Platter. DE-lish!   I phoned in the order with no problems. The chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their  hummus is simply wonderful! I don't know why I didn't try this place out sooner.   The word is that this place ""tastes healthy"" but I think it is perfect! For being a ""healthy"" eatery it sure does have MAS flavor!!!",1,1
"PJ is my favorite restaurant- I got hooked on the Riviara Tuna Salad in 2001. Once you go to the Jungle, you will always want to go back. They have a unique and distinct style and their walls are decorated with local artists work. All of their locations are awesome. The menu is nothing short of amazing. What I love about PJ is that the menu choices are vast and different, healthy. Come with an appetite, the portions are enormous.",1,1
"I remember the first time I ate at a Pita Jungle was probably 4 years ago.  I never heard of it.  I was with a coworker and a vendor.  We just wrapped up a meeting and it was close.  I tried their Tuna and Hummus and had a Shwarma.  I was hooked after that.   We ate here after a long week.  Since we have to travel back and forth and this place was on the way.   I ordered the Tuna and Hummus for a appetizer and it was good.  I ordered the Pesto Turkey Lovash with out cheese or tomatoes.  It was good as always.  I like this place a lot and the service and food has been consistently good.  I tend to stick with my favourite menu items too.  I have tried a couple of different things.  I will do the pizza on a pita with chicken, PLTW, Shwarma and the Mediterranean salad with chicken too.  The good is always good.",1,1
"Food was unique in bold variety of flavors. It was light, healthy, fresh, refreshing, and so delucious. My first time, won't be my last.",1,1
"I love you Pita Jungle. Not only do you have a separate menu for us vegans, but now you have a Tapas Happy Hour and a kids menu?! Hold the phone!  The Tapas Happy Hour is daily from 3pm-5:30pm and the plates are all $1-$3. My favorites include the hummus trio sampler and the falafel (comes with 2). Delicious!",1,1
"Out on a date and he says ""Pita Jungle"" after the show.  I say OK!  I am in love with the red bell pepper hummus and rice pudding ~  We get there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday (today) afternoon.  Not a wait (great!) we sit by the wall so we can hear each other!  The place is always noisy as it is a cafeteria type setup.  Our waitress was on top of things, wine, ordering, etc.    He orders the Faluja somethings which are like vegan meatballs in a salad.  We share the Moroccan Gazpacho Soup (YUM YUM YUM) and I lay into the hummus.    Needless to say with all that food we were stuffed!  With 2 glasses of wine I was ready to take a walk (in Phoenix I think it was like 120,000 degrees outside) so we walked around the misters ~   Clean place, staff ready to serve, food a plenty, and he treated :-)  The bill was only $39.00 with all that scrumptious food!  ~ Luana Joya Lucia",1,1
"This is Jacque Wright and I eat at Arcadia Pita Jungle all the time.  I certainly want to commend the staff and the food.  I also want to point out that this location as well as other store locations also offer art to view on the walls from our various artists in the art community.  This work is performed by Jason Savaglio, the art curator for all the Pita Jungles.  He does a great job of artist selections, placement, and displays on a monthly basis for all the stores.  I have met him and he is actually a school art teacher too.  I give kudos to Jason Savaglio for doing such a fine service and adding to our joy of art - you can view it and buy it too!  If you want to talk to Jason, ask for him at the Arcadia Pita Jungle and I'm sure they can get a message to him.  He is the greatest!! GOOD WORK AND JOB WELL DONE Award from me!",1,1
"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try.",1,1
"The food here is perfection...its fresh and delicious...the hummus is a great starter and I love the chicken schwarma wrap, beef gyro, pesto chicken pizza and the mediterranean chicken salad!! I go there about once a week and I alternate between those choices...they have great smoothies too...my coworker told me to try a carib peanut butter banana smoothie and I thought it was gonna be awful but it was perfect...its enough for a small lunch...the open setting is great and the staff is nice...it gets crowded but be patient its worth it!",1,1
"While I don't falter often from my usual order, everything from Pita Jungle that I've had has been great. I usually get the half jalapeno/half roasted red bell pepper hummus followed by the glazed chicken lavosh. The lavosh is absolutely amazing, toasted in their wood fire oven and topped with generous portions of the honey glazed chicken and feta cheese. The half green tea/half lemonade arnold palmer is my refreshment of chioce, refreshing my taste buds and preparing them for another round of the excellent food.   The servers here are great too, but I don't mean in a white-glove waiter sort of way. These are the people that are fresh off the bong, and honestly, I'm surprised the food even makes it to the table intact. Don't get me wrong, If they were to change this I may not frequent as much. I enjoy my fare share of baked-out-of-their-mind servers, there's just less stress!    The only negative thing I can think of about this place is that the dishes are a little too expensive to make it a weekly stop and the tables are pretty crowded together. Other than that I've never seen anything to complain about.   I also love the ever-changing art from local talent! Very chill place...",1,1
"Pita Jungle is pretty decent I've had their chicken shwarma plates every time I go.  It's pretty college-neo hippie-veggie-art on the walls is for sale-type of place.  Not to say that's a negative, just a weird vibe for me personally. Haji Baba is just down the street and personally that is more my speed and I think their hummus is better too.",1,1
We were introduced to Pita Jungle by some good friends and we have been going back for the excellent food and quick service ever since. Often we order take out when we n want a delicious quick meal and don't feel like cooking. I highly recommend the Mediterranean Chicken Salad for a light hearty meal. It's all good!,1,1
"One of the best spots to eat hands down.  I swear there is nothing bad on this menu.  Good for groups without the guilt on your waistline or your wallet.  No matter what I order, I have to set a side of the garlic potatoes...YUM!!",1,1
"PIta Jungle is one of my favorites. I think I may have tried almost ever item. From their pitas to their tasty appetizers to their smoothies - it's amazing. It's the restaurant I take any of my vegan and vegetarian friends too - same with gluten free. I just recently got into their entrees, and I love their wood-fired salmon with potatoes and sauteed spinach. It is so good. I get to-go here all the time, so tasty!  HOWEVER, I've usually had poor service at this location. They know their food is so good, it's like they don't have to be pleasant when you eat there. The food usually comes out promptly and it's always tasty - but my gripe has always been with a server who just didn't seem like they cared. BUT totally worth overlooking for this food. Really good for pretty cheap!",1,1
"Always a great change from the typical sandwich. Thing is, there are so many other things that I could eat here. Went with my girlfriend who had the Mahi Mahi. Looked like a meal you would get at a high end restaurant. My fav: the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus. So good! I could eat tubs of this stuff. Oh wait, I did!  Always leave this place stuffed, but never have that ""I can't believe I just ate that"" feeling. Okay, I will confess I had a Bosa Donut on the way home. Hey, It's 113 out what else do you do in Phoenix.",1,1
Simple. Black bean burger. Yes. Jalapeño hummus. Absolutely Beer. I'm there. Good prices. Done and done!,1,1
"Pita Jungle is a great spot! Dress-up, dress-down, come straight from a workout... no need to worry at Pita Jungle. The servers are laid back and the vibe is always good. The food is fantastic. You can try something new every time and won't be disappointed - there's something for everyone. Don't be scared by the ""healthy"" look to this place. Some of the best things are the Blue Nachos and the Four Cheese Quesidilla - yum! Plus the Mediterranean Salad is to die for. Portions are big enough to share so get a couple things and branch out.",1,1
"Every time I'm back in Phoenix, I plan when and how often I'm going to Pita Jungle.  I've taken three separate groups of friends, and they have all become instant fans.   Love the outdoor seating area. My daughter has celiac disease, and she is always pleased with how many options she has and how tasty everything is.  I went to the E. Indian School Road location today and again was blissfully happy with everything.  Now, please let me preface this by saying I was there on a weekday early evening and the place wasn't busy.   My service was top notch and friendly.  I had the hummus trio and the garlic chicken from the tapas menu.  Both were super tasty and I know I'll try the garlic chicken off the main menu (appys) when I go next time.   I also had my regular, the chicken shawarma pita with extra garlic sauce. Perfect as usual. Of course, because I'd had the tapas, I took 2/3 home with me for lunch tomorrow.  Can't wait.  I almost forgot - how silly of me.  Of course I had a glass of their sangria.  My fav.  It was perfect as well.   Can I just say that I am pleasantly surprised by reading the responses from Pita Jungle to any negative reviews they see here on yelp.   I'll definitely be back and will be bringing more friends when I do!",1,1
"I dig the atmosphere, I enjoy their food. Good service and a tastey schwarma left me with nothing to complain about. The pita and hummus made for a delicious appetizer. We left feeling full and happy.",1,1
"Great Mediterranean food.  They do the classics well and come up with great original dishes.  I eat here all the time, sit down and take out.  Service is always good.",1,1
"Pita Jungle was one the first places I ate when I moved here 14 years ago. It was right by ASU and delivered on those days I was too hungover to get out of bed which was a PLUS. Since then I have really enjoyed their grilled chix pitas, smoothies, and tsatziki. I was grateful they opened up an Arcadia location a few years ago..Whenver I want a consistemtly good chicken pita this is my goto spot. But as of late I have been attending their reverse happy hour which starts at 9 and goes till close which is around 10. They have a list of 10-15 tapas for $1-3 per item. I get the shrimp which comes with 2 ($3), plate of thyme and herb pita- 1 buck, trio of hummus 2 bux..u get the point. Its the healthy dollar menu!! check it out if u want a late night snack.",1,1
"holy crap.  try the side order of garlic mushrooms.  they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth.  also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.  service was fine, not exceptional, but the staff was friendly enough. i'm so HAPPY i found this place.  go there.",1,1
The jungle is the best.  My wife and I can get dinner and a bottle of wine for less than forty bucks.   And half their meals are to big to eat in one sitting.,1,1
"So good, so healthy and the hummus selection is outstanding.  As well the chicken is juicy as can be.  Thanks to our waiter we got a very good pour on our wine.",1,1
"So this place opened only about a month ago, and I don't even think I can count the number of times I've been here already on both hands. I really like Pita Jungle-- laid back atmosphere, beautiful interior, delicious food! Yes, the waitstaff can be slow at times, but they are young kids, and I feel they generally fit more in the ""atmosphere"" category than ""staff,"" meaning they are all young and cool and hip, and thus contribute to the whole vibe of the place.   I could make a thousand recommendations, but I won't. Just read over the huge menu and try something you never would have thought of. I promise you, it will be good. I will tell you this, though: this location is still waiting on their liquor license as of my last visit. Have the iced tea, it's yummy! Also, this branch is planning to have delivery service soon. I may never leave my house again!",1,1
"I love the food. I was in one evening and it was hectic and busy. My table was overlooked and when the waiter realized what happened, he couldn't have been more attentive and nice. Everyone makes mistakes--especially when it is crazy busy. For me, it's how they make up for it and that they at least make the effort. I appreciate that.",1,1
The first couple of visits the menu might come off as a little insipid.  Don't let that deter you because your tastebuds need time to detox from all of the fatty burgers you once consumed. You will soon find a menu full of dishes to feel good about.,1,1
Great healthy food and plenty of tasty options. We really like the atmosphere of this location as well,1,1
"This place is consistently fabulous.  Every time I've been there, I've gotten great food and great service.  One of my favorite offerings is the Moroccan Gazpacho.  If you love crunchy veggies and a lot of cilantro, this cold soup is for you.  It is accented with plump golden raisins -- which sounds a little weird, but it is divine.  It adds a little sweetness to the strong (but delicious) onion and cilantro.  The cold tuna pita is also wonderful.  It's served more or less like a salad, with one of Pita Jungle's sublime pita's on top.  It is also topped with sprouts and a light lemony dressing.  Another fine sandwich is the lavosh shawarma wrap.  Oh dear God....  It just makes me happy.  Juicy chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickles and a shmear of garlic sauce.  It's just so good!  If you love hummus, this is another must-try!  The cilantro jalapeno hummus is to die for!  I was actually hoping for it to have a little more of a kick -- it is incredibly mild, but very flavorful.  This is definitely one of my go-to places when friends come in town.  There is always good music in the air, and cool art/photography on the wall.",1,1
"First off, Louis greeted me with a smile, then Dan took my order and since I am a regular he didn't assume that I wanted my usual he took the time to take me through new items on the menu.  Then my food came out flawless.  I went with the lavosh wrap.  I have been on a macro platter kick but I was impressed with my lavosh chicken wrap. James and Tyler were there usual friendly selves.  I like how the servers are not afraid to interact with the customers.  It makes me want to frequent this restaurant.  I can't stand the chains that have no personality.  Pita Jungle is growing and turning into a corporate chain but some how they still manage to keep it feeling like the original in Tempe. Please dont change the personality. This place is my home away from home.  PS Kelsey always helps me get my GREEN TEA refills!!!",1,1
When I lived closeby- this is where I went when I was feeling homesick for Portland food.   My personal favorites-   Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus= Perfect.  Lavosh Pizza= 2nd best thing anyone has ever done with Lavosh (RIP Pischke's).  Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini= Duh  Lentil Fetoosh Salad= That LEMONY DRESSING!  Chicken Combination Platter= Perfect high protein lunch,1,1
"The husband and I went to Pita Jungle last night at approximately 6:30. I was very hungry, perhaps on the verge of hangry (a dramatic form of hunger) and so we promptly ordered an appetizer ( large hummus trio, to be specific). In my amazement, the large platter was set before me only seconds after I ordered. It was like magic. It was brilliant. It was faster than any fast food service I have ever received. The platter was visually appealing with a green hummus (cilantro), a red hummus (red pepper) and yellow (normal hummus).  I also ordered steam vegetables - partly to be healthy, and also partly for additional dipping options. I've never been to a place the supplied a good pita bread to hummus ratio - you always need an extra pita.  But, the carrots especially made a good hummus-to-mouth shoveling vehicle.   That is the only problem I have with Pita Jungle though, I always have to order an appetizer in order to get full. And, it's not that the serving sizes are too small because the serving plates are large and completely utilized. So, I don't know, it's like how my kitchen spoons always go missing - I don't have an explanation. It's not like they ever leave the house.  Giving 5 stars for such a good service.  I've been eating at Pita Jungle for years and the food is always good, although I would probably give 4 stars if just on taste alone. But service in seconds? It's hard to beat that.  Friendly staff, outdoor seating, and wine help seal the deal.",1,1
"I tried this place for the first time today and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and it was fresh and full of wonderful flavors.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the choice of ingredients was unexpected yet delicious!  Kudos to the chef and owners for great quality food at a good price.    HOWEVER....  I take off a star because of the outrageously rude service.  I was dining alone and was not only ignored by my server, but when I asked to pay he did not answer and only glared at me.  He brought the check a moment later with no smile or ""How was the food?"".  The only contact made by any staff member once my order was taken was by a buser that took my plate away.  Shame on the server for having a severe attitude problem, but double shame on the restaurant for staffing their restaurant with disrespectful employees.",1,1
"Mmmm...Pita Jungle.   The food is fresh, affordable and tasty. I like the atmosphere a lot. Great for groups or a dinner date.",1,1
I have never tried this wonderful restaurant before I finely went with a friend a week ago Friday and I am no totally addicted and I have only got the same dish the sizzling broiled chicken salad  I have now gone back 4 times with in a weeks time I love it and the staff is so kind and very nice and attentive and worth a good tip,1,1
"I feel a bit silly even writing a review of Pita Jungle...I mean everyone likes this place, right?  Well I have never been disappointed by the food and I've tried just about everything on their menu (but always end up back at the Chicken and Hummus appetizer).  The only complaint I have with this location is how close all of the tables are to one another.  It's kind of tough to have a super private conversation in here during a busy time...but that doesn't stop me normally.  Pita Jungle has definitely become one of my go-to restaurants when I can't figure out what I want to eat because I know they are reliably good.",1,1
"Arrived around 5:30, the place was kinda empty. We had the Rock and roll fries and the chicken wings. It's was ok. The crowd picked up around 7 but we left a little bit after. Great place.",1,1
"Came here for a Sunday lunch and was impressed by the atmosphere and just how genuinely cool this place is. Decided to try some food in the restaurant area behind the bowling alley. The little clown faces are cool to look at. Now, for the food I decided to try the ribeye which was ok. I should've gone with something else more closer to the other items on the menu. My girlfriend had the fried chicken which was delicious. I wish I would've grabbed that instead. I kept picking off her plate the whole time. The chicken was really juicy on the inside and the skin had a great crunch and just an overall great flavor. The price is about $20 which comes with four pieces of chicken and mash. I will definitely be getting that the next time I come here. Oh, and make sure to use the hot sauce which added that extra kick. All in all I would recommend this place if you're willing to spend a little more money on a dinner or lunch that you normally would.",1,1
"5 stars for sure!! We had such a good experience!   I love this venue. I like the  dimly lit atmosphere , high ceilings, carnival/ industrial vibe.  Had dinner and drinks in the bar. Our server was Patrick and he was great. Attentive, relaxed, funny. We ordered the fried pickles, poutine fries, Mac n cheese and fried chicken. It was all delicious. The mac n cheese is baked, creamy yet not super rich. The chicken was hot and crispy.   We saw the Silversun Pickups after dinner. It's a great intimate venue. Stage is right next to the bowling alley and it's not huge so you get an up close and personal experience. The screens above the lanes either have trippy mesmerizing visuals or you can watch the show live. There's a balcony above the main floor, floor standing or near the lanes. Wherever you're watching from, you'll have a great view. Plenty of bars, and no lines.   I would come here again for sure for another show, to bowl or just have a drink/ food. Awesome place.",1,1
"Hey! Fun times!  I was in Vegas because ... Vegas! Stumbled (literally) on the BB and Chris Robinson was playing. One Hamilton later I'm upstairs in line for a beer and the band is sounding good. Magic Hat on tap? Yes please, plus a Stella.  Sound is good, lighting is better.  Think House of Blues but with a bowling alley.  Overall a great venue with entertainment most nights.",1,1
"The atmosphere concert was awesome! The bartenders and food was great! Will have to come back again, upset that i missed wutang clan :(",1,1
"The Brooklyn Bowl is part of the new Linq Promenade which is located on the strip between the Flamingo and the Linq casinos. It's actually a really cool area with tons of bars and places to shop and eat.   The Bowl is a combination restaurant/bowling alley/music venue. It's two levels with the restaurant area, some bowling lanes and the stage on the first level, then the second level (the balcony) is like a whole second venue with it's own bowling lanes, bar, bathrooms, huge leather couches everywhere, and you can look down onto the stage below.   We went to see a concert so we opted for the seating in the balcony level. The great thing was that even though the venue was packed downstairs, upstairs there was plenty of space. No lines for the bathrooms or bar, and they have servers to take food orders. So it was a really nice experience. My only complaint about being on the balcony is that the view of the stage is very limited. Unless you are standing right against the balcony rail, you cannot see the stage, and there's only so much rail space. A huge architectural oversight in my opinion. Luckily there wasn't many people upstairs and we got a space against the rail, but I would feel sorry for people attending a more packed show.   After the show we went downstairs and had dinner and it was really good and not terribly expensive. The wait staff was outstanding as well. My wife knocked her wine glass over by accident and the staff was on it immediately, cleaning up and assuring us that it was no problem. And they refilled her glass for free. Great service.   So overall this place rocks! Bowling, food, drinks, music... it doesn't get much better.",1,1
Great spot! The fried chicken was delicious and the fries app was a great twist on cheese fries. Service was good and it was a cool venue. We did not bowl but the setup looked like a fun time. The girl at the Cosmo recommended it and we enjoyed the experience. I would recommend it as fun casual option on the strip. Only down side was no copper cup for the Moscow mule which based on the bar set up it seemed like they would. I can't really ding them for that though...,1,1
"It's located in The Linq right before the High Roller Wheel; next to Sprinkles Cupcakes. Some of my favs from the Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas menu are the Fried Calamari, The Greek French Bread Pizza, Chicken Muffuletta, and the famous Rock And Roll Fries. It's an amazing standing music venue, restaurant, and bowling alley. Where else can you experience all three experiences all together. It's also great place just to hangout with friends on a normal night out and grab a beer on tap.",1,1
"This place might be known as the hot new concert venue, but it shouldn't be overlooked for its food. With a menu from the Bromberg brothers of Blue Ribbon fame, their fried chicken has garnered much praise. The mixed fried chicken dinner might be pricey (at least for lunch) but it didn't disappoint. Consisting of half a chicken -- one breast, wing, thigh, and drumstick -- it's plenty filling for almost any hungry diner. Plus it comes with mashed potatoes and collard greens. You'd be hard pressed to find an exterior as delicately crispy, crunchy, and flavorful as the one coating this fried chicken. Along with meat that was juicy and tender, it was by far the best fried chicken I've had in town.",1,1
"I truly love the whole new area that is ""the Linq"" on the Strip, and Brooklyn Bowl is no exception to the awesomeness.  This modern day bowling alley/concert venue/restaurant/dancehall/anything else you want to imagine it to be is so impressive looking with a hip and fresh vibe that says, ""Welcome to cool."" It really felt like I stepped into Brooklyn Bowl on Wythe avenue in New York, but with the comfort of knowing you're still out west where the weather is best.  I especially appreciate that you can watch all the action on the stage while you're knocking down 10 pins and knocking back some cocktails, but my visit here was to see the O.A.R. concert.   The acoustics were impressive, and I like the fact that you can get pretty close to the stage while you rock it with the band. It looks like Brooklyn bowl will continue to host some impressive musical guests, but the next time I come back I want to try out the lanes and the food.  Keep up the good work,  Brooklyn Bowl!",1,1
"Went for a show 5/30 great sound at a very cool venue.  Bought giant beers outside at their beer stand.  Place is a lot larger than I thought it would be.  Not much seating in concert area, seems to be a lot of empty space.  Will try it again.",1,1
"Our family LOVED this venue.  We spent an afternoon bowling, eating chicken wings, drinking cold beer and enjoying great music and service.  The atmosphere is awesome, the service is awesome and it's just plain fun for children and adults alike.  Would love to attend one of their live concerts some evening when I'm in town without my children!",1,1
"I went on one of the nights they offered free bowling for 90 minutes plus half off food for locals.  Couldn't get over the size of the place!  Vegas has come a long way from the Gold Coast bowling alley.  At least GC still has all those great photos of people in bowling poses for scoring 300.    Good luck throwing a 300 here!  If anyone manages to do it with all the flashing lights and pizza grease on your thumb enhancing the spin of the ball ever so slightly, you might test positive for some substances.  I'd also like to meet you.   But bowling good isn't what it's all about at Brooklyn Bowl.  I feel that's true but I might still be like 2% sore over losing to a girl.  Not even barely.....dominated.  The atmosphere is really cool, good beers on tap starting at $8, and the balcony could be sneaky chill when it gets warmer.  A lot of fun will be had at this venue.        I wasn't digging the seats for bowling.  It would have been awkward if our party of 4 all sat on the big leather couch together as it was a tight squeeze.  The party of 8 across our table were pretty bunched up.  It also would've been kind of a mess had they ordered drinks and food too since all 12 of us were sharing one (albeit long) table.    Definitely dine before bowling because eating with your hands, playing with balls and then eating more is gross.  Someone is bound for pink eye or worse.  Although ""The Fatty"" pizza was Stouffer's French bread pizza on steroids delicious, I had to eat it with a fork while standing.  That's kinda lame.    It's all minor stuff in the whole picture of things.  Can't wait to check out some shows!  Lots of great acts on the schedule already.",1,1
"Rebel souljahz concert last night was epic!!!! They also have a patio so u can smoke,eat, etc. a lot of reviews are bad for the concert part and most of them are rock music which we attended a reggae concert!!! No pat down intended but why would you were islanders we just smoke bud or drink and we have a great time doing it..it was real good vibes last night got to see my girl Eli Mac which was phenomenal overall experience was dope as faack cheehooo!!!!! P.s. I'm 4'9 and I saw the stage just fine",1,1
One of my new favorite places in the heart of Vegas.When I first saw the wheel being constructed last year I did not get it.Upon seeing the completion of the project I'm very impressed.I love The Linq area of Vegas and also love The Brooklyn Bowl what a great place it's massive.Fried chicken is the house  specialty it looked very good.So drop by if your in the area I don't think you will be disappointed .I know that I will be going back next year!,1,1
"( did not eat here so I cannot speak to the food.  However, the atmosphere of the place is brilliant.  If there is a concert that you want to see at this place, do yourself a favor and get some tix.",1,1
"I ate here on a Monday evening. I had the chicken dinner, Moehead oh and the bread pudding for dessert. The food was very good. I would definitely eat here again.",1,1
This venue is AMAZING! We were here for premonition with Catersource and the party was a BLAST! But more than that the space was great. Bowling was fun and we could still see the show while we were upstairs.,1,1
"The beef Bowl Burger was great. Beer selection was pretty good. I hear the fried chicken is excellent, so I will have to try that next time. Funky atmosphere and good music. Throw in some bowling and a live band and you've got a full evening.",1,1
The venue is huge...the servers were knowledgeable and efficient and the food was good.  We ate a chicken dinner and ribs...both were extremely good.  For dessert we had the chocolate chip bread pudding...it needed something beyond the chocolate.  We will come back to eat and to bowl.,1,1
"Ahhh! This place is so cool and there's nothing quite like it in the SF Bay Area!  Brooklyn Bowl is restaurant, bar, bowling alley, and music venue! My boyfriend and I were in LV for a few nights and came here for Galactic's midnight show. The sound was great and there was plenty of room for dancing. They also keep the entire place well air-conditioned so that was definitely a huge plus for me.  The best part about Brooklyn Bowl is their fried chicken. I think I talk about it at least once a week. My boyfriend and I split the 1/2 mixed order which came with mashed potatoes and collared greens (w/bacon). Everything on that plate was PHENOMENAL. The chicken is juicy, well seasoned, fried to perfection, and had just the right amount of heat. Both the sides were also really good, but the chicken was...just unbelievably good.  I can't wait to go back!",1,1
"This review is for the fried chicken alone! My friend had told me they had the best in town, and man he was not lying! This fried chicken is so delicious and flavorful. Love the seasoning and crispiness of the skin too! Also, we tried the roasted adobo corn and after ordering it there definitely have to learn to make it myself because oh my goodness, it is to die for!! Our server was very nice and friendly and accommodating. Great service and great food and sometimes you get to enjoy some live music while you eat.",1,1
I decided to take a stroll around The Linq tonight to check out some of the new restaurants and shops that have popped up in the last month. I stopped into Brooklyn Bowl to grab a bite to eat and was totally impressed! The staff was super friendly (bartender Paul is super hot!) and the food was great! I had the Chicken Muffuletta sandwich with a side of mixed greens. The greens were lightly dressed and the sandwich was absolute perfection. There's an olive spread on the sandwich that bring just the right amount of salt to the meal. Delish! I'll definitely be back!,1,1
"Not reviewing food, just the venue for a concert.  Saw Deftones at Brooklyn Bowl in October 2015.  Great location for a show, fantastic vibe and great staff.  The location is fantastic, and the place is like if you slapped a double level series of bowling lanes to any of the large venue Hard Rock facilitates.  Beer prices pretty high during show ($8-$10). Staff was great, from ticket takers who actually helped me find someone to help me buy 1 for the sold out show.  Security was cool to everyone I saw them interact with.   Great show, great venue",1,1
I came here to see The Used for their 15th anniversary concert. It was my first time at this venue and I completely loved it. It's small enough to where you can pretty much be anywhere and see very well. It's smaller than The Joint but bigger than Vinyl. It's a very unique venue and the decor is pretty sweet. There are a ton of bars surrounding the standing area so you have quick and easy access to them no matter where you are.  I've bowled here before too when there wasn't a concert and it was cool but it's ridiculously expensive. It's like $100 per hour to bowl here which is kind of crazy to me. I will be coming back for a concert but definitely won't be back to bowl.,1,1
"Tickets: BBLV utilizes Ticketfly for online sales. There is a service charge on orders, however, their website doesn't state how it is calculated (it was $6.93 on a $25 ticket). For delivery options, Print-at-Home and Will Call are free, standard mail is $3.50, and UPS 2nd-Day Air is $17.95. The box office is your best bet. There are no service charges and obviously, you don't have to worry about delivery. The downside: there is a credit/debit card processing fee of $3/ticket. However, if you buy your tickets with cash, there are absolutely NO fees! I can't remember the last time I was able to buy a ticket at the posted price.  Shows: The stage is located next to the bowling lanes, near the back of the property. You can actually view it from the lanes and some areas of the dining room. The space is General Admission (standing room only) with VIP sky boxes on both sides of the stage. Ruben and I visited last month for The Naked and Famous show with The 1975 and White Lies. We arrived after the posted ""Doors Open at.."" time, but they weren't allowing anyone to enter, so we were directed to wait on the stairs (with the line starting next to the dining area). Security was rather strict with bag searches, pat-downs, and ID checks. Some shows are 18+ or 21+, so I'm assuming a wristband meant the latter. I like the intimate space of the stage area and this particular show was really great! The sound was good and the venue in general was really cool. The screens on the bowling lanes showed live feed of the show, so it's not a bad idea to reserve a lane instead of buying a ticket. Plus, the stage is open air, so I'm sure the music can be enjoyed everywhere. I would definitely see a show here again.  I haven't had a chance to bowl or try the menu yet (I've had the Blue Ribbon chicken at their Cosmopolitan location), so I'll add it to my review in the future! Anyway, it's a great place to hang out and I love the versatility of the venue.  IMPORTANT Update (12/15/14): The box office does NOT charge a credit card fee anymore. However, there is a standard $2 fee on every ticket purchased at the box office. Still MUCH cheaper than purchasing online!! The processing fee on Ticketfly's website was $10 and some change for a $35 ticket. It's ridiculous. Also, tickets are now more expensive on the day of the show.",1,1
"Awesome concept. We came in for a late lunch- everything was good, my fave by far is the corn- spicy & delicious.  Avoid the kids pizza.",1,1
"After giving the BB a few chances on experience within the venue for shows, a couple of go's in the restaurant and a try in bowling, I figure that it's time to weigh in.  Starting with the restaurant, I had the steamed fish... who am I kidding, the menu is basically chicken, chicken, oh and, did you see this other chicken? So, I went for the chicken! Once with a waffle for brunch, and more recently, the fella and I split the Mixed Chicken@ dinner, complete with mashed potatoes and a sub-in of mixed greens. I'd say, there is a huge portion here to split, and that made for a very reasonable a tasty dinner. Seriously, could not have tried  dessert if my life depended on it! Had a couple drinks, an enjoyable time and on to the show (I must say, having everything under one smooth roof is a super bonus of this spot).  On to the venue... if perhaps the food sits in a little above mediocrity, for a Vegas concert venue on the Strip, I've been most impressed with their venue. Very easy to navigate between the patio and stage area. Plenty of room. Even in a full house, I have yet to feel claustrophobic like some other Vegas places give me the blues when I'm packed in like a sardine... See what I did there? Also, with your wristband, you can come and go, another big bonus.  Last experience was the bowling. When we played it was up to 8 people for $100 per hour, included shoe rentals and some great graphics, music and service. I felt that for the fun and good vibes our large group had at the BB, it really couldn't be beat!",1,1
"Went here to see PRIMUS in concert. This place attracts all types of music genres, thus attracting all types of people. The set up is awesome. Bars aplenty, with hip lighting, and an old carnival feel. The acoustics are great, the layout is fun. During intermission, my sister and I had a bathroom break and didn't have a problem finding a table at one of the restaurant/bar areas (the area directly to your right as you come up off the escalator). The best part was that PRIMUS seemed to have an ongoing 'cartoon' playing during their intermission, and we didn't miss a thing since we watched from the many TVs set up in the eating area. Definitely looking forward to going back to bowl, and partaking in some of the delicious looking menu items.   Prime location, in the heart of the Linq. Prime people watching. Prime sounds. Prime eats. (using the word PRIME a lot, as to tie in the band I was at Brooklyn Bowl for-PRIMus.) Sometimes I'm just like that. =)  Can't wait to go back!",1,1
"Went here for the free show on Thursday night. It's a really nice venue. I had the pork sliders for dinner, they were just ok, nice fresh buns but the pork was lacking a little in the flavor department. Fair price of $8 for 3.  The music shows were a lot of fun. Rhyme N Rhythm was fun, got you dancing, Coco plays a mean bass guitar, and Moksha was really great. They played at least 2 1/2 hours, great jam. My legs are sore this morning from dancing all night. I really liked that the sound levels didn't blast you out of the building.Drinks were $12 for vodka/cran.   Overall a great night out....nothing like free entertainment in Vegas!",1,1
"This was the first time that I've actually been inside the Brooklyn Bowl. It's actually pretty nice. There's a lot going on. They have their restaurant. I didn't go to that, but they did have a lady outside giving out samples of their fried chicken so I gave that a try and it was good. We went to see P.O.D. that was performing last night. They have a decent size area in front of the stage. They also have a few tables in the back that you can stand at. It's a lot better set up than some places out here. There are plenty of bars throughout the place. The bartender we had poured a generous amount of alcohol in our drinks. The drinks weren't ridiculous either. I think beer and well drinks were $8-9. I haven't actually bowled there so I can't comment on the bowling aspect, but I will say it did look nice and the bowling pins were pretty cute with their faces and stuff.",1,1
Came in after we were ignored at another bar across the way and it was the best thing that could of happened... great happy hour and the fried chicken is to die for. Had a blast listening to an array of differebt music. will come back here for sure,1,1
"Beautiful venue! The disco ball upon entering is mesmerizing, and the bar/stage/bowling area is just great. The food and drinks are about the same price you'd pay anywhere else on the strip (on the higher side). The price to actually bowl is the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars; way way way too expensive.",1,1
Love this place. Going during the day is fun for the whole family. My 6 year old loves it. They have a desk for locals make sure to ask for it. The couches are cool and comfy. They also have a huge restaraunt and it looks very cool for a music venue. Can't wait to see a show.   The fried chicken is delicious as well as the Stella cider.,1,1
"Amazing service! Seriously, I don't think I've ever been so picked up after.  Loved the Rock & Roll fries, but they're an acquired taste for sure. And the fried chicken...so good. Crispy goodness served with collard greens and mashed potatoes. The atmosphere is fun...a little loud next to the bowling alley, but it's not fine dining so it's not terrible.  Oh, and the adobo corn...get that!",1,1
"Nice addition to The Linq.  I want to hate The Linq but they keep adding great things.  A bunch of brand new bowling alleys, great drink and food service plus an awesome bar.  Tons of big screens everywhere which was great for watching hockey playoffs!  I'm a fan of this place.",1,1
"Came here to see Purity Ring & had some dinner at the bar prior. I had the pulled pork entree, which was a GIANT open faced sandwich. If you're looking for delicious comfort food, you've found it! Tons of pork piled on a  piece of amazing bread coupled with mashed taters & i subbed out the coleslaw for a mixed greens salad....YUM. I didn't want to stop eating and there was so much food. I didn't feel like carrying leftovers, so I was sad to bid my remaining food goodbye. That was a whole next meal :)  The venue as far as a show goes is pretty awesome! Small and intimate without feeling claustrophobic, Brooklyn Bowl is a great choice. There are 3 bars in the concert area and plenty off security and staff.  Getting out of the venue was a little hectic, bottleneck city! Overall, amazing. I will seek shows at Brooklyn Bowl whenever I'm in Vegas.",1,1
"Went to see Thievery Corporation 6/10. Nice venue with ample space and ease of access to bar areas.  The sound system was A+.  Prices for drinks were on par with The Strip.  All staff were friendly and helpful. Nice balcony area for smokers overlooking The Linq.  Bathrooms were tidy and equipped with an attendant who supplied a nice array of toiletries.    Brooklyn Bowl would get five stars if they provided more seating and tables in the venue area because, there's literally four tiny bar height tables each equipped with 2-4 seats. Besides these and the two bars, there are no other places to sit or sit your drink down (unless you rent a bowling lane).",1,1
"The food and the service were excellent.  I had reservations and arrived about ten minutes early, the hostess seated us right away.  Drinks and appetizers were quick and delicious.   The place was gearing up for a live band, most every weekend, and the crowd was lively.",1,1
"Came here with a group of friends to see The Green perform.. While walking up to BB we saw a huge line of people and got worried but that was just the line for the box office.. If you had already purchased your ticket, you were able to walk straight to the entrance and head up the escalators...   I really love the space of BB.. You are free to stand and listen to the music, get as close to the stage or as far away as you want, dance with your friends or go outside on the patio and hang out.. At one point one of my GFs and I were too drunk and wanted to sit down so we got a table in the restaurant section.. which BTW from our booth, we had a great view of the stage.. We ordered cheese fries which came out to be over $13 (a bit overpriced IMO) but service was friendly, especially the drink runner, Pons!  I will definitely be coming back to the Brooklyn Bowl and will hopefully be taking advantage of some of the bowling promotions that they do for locals~  HOT TIP: BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE! It's cheaper and gets you in faster...",1,1
"A very hip place living in an up and coming area, The Linq.  Brooklyn Bowl has a very sleek and cool atmosphere with hard wood floors and leather couches.  And if bowling is your thing, they have some lanes to accommodate you.  The best thing about bowling there, is that you can see the stage from the lanes.  And you can watch any performance while you bowl.  Plus Brooklyn Bowl has giant screens at the end of the lanes that show the stage too.",1,1
"I really dig this venue. The Roots were playing on the night I went - I arrived early to start the night off with drinks and some of their famous fried chicken.   The fried chicken was top notch. Loved the seasoning on it. Probably the best I've had in this city (Note: Vegas isn't really known for fried chicken). Super juicy, but not too greasy. Real good combo with some beer (Magic Hat on tap) . Came up to $20 for 4 pieces of chicken, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and a slice of white bread. Wasn't too hungry so I shared it with a friend. Good stuff to munch on while waiting. You can either eat indoors or outdoors with a view of the Linq that's great for people watching.  As a music venue, it's really great too. It's just an overall fun atmosphere to be around. Plenty of bars, lots of walking room, and a outdoor 2nd story patio for some air. I also liked the fact that you can get away from the stage to some seats where you can actually hear conversations with company.  I didn't get to try out the bowling, but the alley looked really modern and trendy. More upscale than most bowling alleys that I've seen.  All in all, a really great venue that offers a lot to do. It looks like they have some great artists lined up to perform in the future. I'm definitely going to be dropping by here often.",1,1
This place is awesome.  I can hardly wait to watch The Roots there in January. Ticket prices are soo reasonable. Beers about 7bucks. This is definitely a spot to plan a day to.,1,1
"Best place to watch a concert, you can't beat the sound. If there is a type of music you like, regardless if you know the band, give it a shot. They have free shows all the time. The only minus is the drink prices.",1,1
"Cool spot ! Hands down a vegas gem . Didn't have much expectations for a bowling alley in Vegas and to my surprised this place was awesome . Super clean , socks available for purchase , and techy lanes . This place has a cool rock n roll vibe .",1,1
"I came here about three times. There are several bars located on both sides of a spacious floor with a stage for performers at one end. There is no seating so be prepared to stand.  Glow bowling, good food, great venue for bands. Bowling is a little pricey and it's goes by 1/2 hr instead of by game, but it's Vegas so it comes with the territory. They have their world famous fried chicken which I haven't tried yet. Above every bowling lane is a big-screen TV that plays the concert while you bowl. The only area that has seats (big comfortable leather couches).   Try to get your tickets online before the show and save some bucks.This place is  fun and not the huge arena experience. Oh check out the balcony too, there are seatings and great people watching area.  For a full night of entertainment, this is the place to be!",1,1
"Had one of the best weekends of my life at Brooklyn Bowl!!! What brought me here was to see Primus play three nights in a row during a weekend in May. Arrived early to beat the line and to purchase some merch. It was relatively easy to claim a spot near the front of the stage. The size of the GA area is nice, comparable to HOB. Drink prices are fair and it's a fun vibe with the bowling alleys off to the side. Food is also good, had the French Bread Pizza. Good times!!",1,1
"Located in The Linq, what do you get when you mix a a restaurant, a bar, a live music venue and a bowling alley? Why Brooklyn Bowl of course! Great food and good prices for the strip. This place is just a lot of fun, a must do in Las Vegas!Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1,1
"I've been dying for a strawberry and rhubarb pie which seems like forever! I came across Pies N More just the other night, I walked in ( it was after closing time) and I ordered one pie. I knew I loved this place when I walked in after hours to be exact it was 15 mins after closing time and the employees were still happy to take my order and mentioned that they were closed on Mondays but would be happy to have it ready for Tuesday.  I went and picked up the pie today and it was exactly what I was looking for!!! The pie was FANTASTIC!!! I absolutely loved it! It brings me back to my childhood days of my mom making this same pie. I will definitely be back! The owner was very pleasant to deal with along with his employees who took my order the other night. I would highly recommend Pies N More to anyone looking for a great pie! Thank you Pies N More you've gain a regular customer and for a quick desert you took me immediately back to my childhood days when my mom would bake for us! You guys ROCK!!!!!",1,1
"I love pie, and I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to pies. I want to see a good crust first and foremost, and if I can find that I'm hooked. Well, consider me hooked!  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Pies N More. The place is in a rather unsightly strip mall, with a liquor store, a Goodwill and a dollar store. It's right next to a Pizza Hut carry out. I almost drove by instead of going in.  I'm so glad I did. I ordered two chicken pot pies, a cherry pie and an apple pie. They were all still warm from the oven and smelled amazing. The small chicken pot pie made a good meal for one person, and is comfort food at its finest. The cherry pie was my favorite, though the apple pie was good too.  I love the couple that run the business. It's a mom-and-pop shop, which I always want to support, and they seem really sweet and enthusiastic about the business.  There is no decent pie shop for miles around, so I really hope this place makes it.",1,1
"First time visiting here, will not be my last.   Had a slice of Peach Mango pie,  crust is amazing (reminds me of Marie Callendars crust).   Also had a old favorite, Chicken Pot pie,  delicious!   Service was friendly, family run business that makes you feel at home.    Highly recommended this place for a To Go pie or sit in lunch.",1,1
"Family run business with service with friendly that makes you feel at home    First time here after the Nielsen's Frozen Custard closed. S/W corner on Baseline and Power right next to a Pizza Hut carry out.  Lots of pies to try Cream pies: Chocolate Banana Coconut Raspberry Strawberry Fruit pies: Apple Cherry Peach Peach Mango Berry Berry (Raspberry, Blackberry & Blueberry) They also have Sandwiches and a special pie offer with a sandwich.  Next time we try the Chicken Pot pie & peach-mango.",1,1
"Excellent quality in pies and food. Made fresh and the owners have a real passion for quality, service and creating an experience that will keep customers coming back and telling there friends. Wishing you guys the best of luck as you deserve it...",1,1
Hot fudge pie was beyond wonderful !!!!   Took it to a pot luck and was a big hit.!!!,1,1
"We stopped in to have lunch and pie, what a wonderful surprise!  Great soup and sandwich and the chicken pot pie was perfect.  The chocolate cream pie was awesome, as well as the peach-mango.  Friendly service and cute atmosphere too, it is our new favorite place!",1,1
"Pie was really good! Tried several kinds - banana cream, cherry, peach, and berry. The service was quick and friendly. Food (sandwiches and soup) was pretty good, not great. Will order holiday pies from here from now on!",1,1
"I'm surprised by the negativity of the other reviews, but perhaps this place is better when you call ahead of time and set up a tasting. We were looking to place an order for about 14-15 pies for our wedding. I asked to try five flavors - the chocolate peanut butter, the berry berry, the chocolate raspberry, the coconut, and blackberry raspberry. They had all of them ready for me when I arrived, and they did not charge for the tasting. These aren't perfect pies - the judges on the Great British Baking Show would fault them for soggy crust in the berry pies and imperfect appearance. But seriously, they only charge $13/pie, which is an unbeatable price for good pies. The chocolate peanut butter mousse was particularly delicious, but they apparently don't make it all that often, so you would probably want to call ahead to order that one. I found the couple that runs it charming, and they were certainly very friendly to me.",1,1
Pies N More is on the s/w corner on Baseline and Power.  I loved Marie Callenders pies but they left AZ and now I have found Pies N More and it is delicious. Banana cream pie was served at my Bunco night.  One bite and you are hooked.   I'm picking up two pies for this weekend - girls weekend in Pine...  Enjoy...,1,1
"I ordered two spinach and cheese pies to go for a school event, and they were a great hit! Fresh made and delicious...thanks!",1,1
I love this place. The food is fresh and top rate. Coconut cream pie is my favorite and they make the best I have ever eaten. Service is friendly and accommodating. Am getting hungry writing this and think I will go back tomorrow since they will now be open on Mondays!,1,1
"I came here last Saturday after volunteering. My choice was the chicken Alfredo with breadsticks. Very pleasant, creamy taste. As soon as they finished preparing it, they brought it out. The downside to the place is the bus system. There is plenty of construction going around this area and I had to ask a passerby for help getting the bus. Therefore, I doubt if I will come back.",1,1
My favorite! Inexpensive and quick. All the dishes I have tried are wonderful. I really like the Fettuccine Alfredo!   Also the bruschetta is great! Fantastic!,1,1
Very friendly staff. Went during the week not busy at all. And foods good. Especially the breadsticks :),1,1
"I've only been here once, and it was good. I had the noodles that was basically Pad Thai with added chicken. Yum!",1,1
Pad Thai was excellent and my coworkers loved their alfredo as well.,1,1
Pretty good food every time. Nice staff a little pricey for somethings but the quality is good and the place is clean.  Alfredo okay....but not very flavorful.,1,1
Craving something good but can't decide between Italian food or Asian food? Then this is the place to stop at. Similar to Noodles And Company but more of a local twist that makes this place unique. Wide variety of foods to choose from and can be customized to fill your craving needs. Lots of space and service is friendly. Prices can range from $10-$13 average per person. Downside about location is that parking is curbside so be ready to look for parking.,1,1
"Went yesterday and was pleased.  Ordered the Thai Peanut noodles.  Lots of deliciously fresh veggies and the meat tasted great.  Plus, they were filling a huge catering order so the meal took a bit to get to me, so the manager brought me free breadsticks.  Most places don't even know you're there once you order and she sought me out, apologized, and brought me free sticks!  Great service!!!",1,1
"Gluten free options! First timer here and it was delicious.  You place your order at the register, select a seat and they bring your food out to you. We selected the outdoor patio because it was dog friendly and our dog was with us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even brought our dog water.   Beer and wine are available  We recommend the lobster ravioli!!",1,1
"As always, excellent food and excellent service! Love this place!! There's something for everyone. The food is cooked to your specifications too. I always take home half of my order, so it's like two meals for the price of one! Major deals!!",1,1
"Feel in love with this place in Charlotte. You can choose a wide option of items from the menu. I loved the Asian/ Thai flare that I could get here. No matter if you like Italian, Asian, or most any other ethnic taste....you can find it here.",1,1
"I have an addictive personality so once i find something I like I can't get enough of it. I found out about NBN at an office meeting that was catered by them. Ever since then it's been love at first sight lol. The pasta is fresh and made to order, not to mention there are so many options, from Asian to Italian dishes. All pasta entrees come with a breadstick. Portions are really good and so is the pricing. Appetizers are great too! I've had the tomato bisque with extra cream and it was delicious.Their salads are great too. There's plenty of options for kids as well. The space is pretty by so it's good for a group plus there is outdoor seating for sunny days. I've visited several times and it's turned into a family favorite. I've been pleased with every dish I have tried ( pasta campanelli, spicy Cajun pasta, pesto pasta, lobster ravioli, and the kids pizza - don't judge me lol. The staff is always friendly there's a points/ rewards system here so for every purchase you get points that ultimately result in 10$ of your meal once you reach a specific number (I'm not sure what it is) lol.",1,1
Love this place. The Padthai noodles are delicious. The prices are good for your wallet also.,1,1
The noodles here are just too good!!!! I love them and they're so delicious!!! The spicy Japanese udon and fettuccine Alfredo is delicious. I'm going back there today to try a different type of noodles. Highly recommended! Great price and great portions!!!,1,1
"This place is a small walk away from CPCC.  For a place that claims they have NOTHING but noodles, they had a pretty decent Greek salad. It was plated nicely, tasted pretty good (and fresh), and they added a little fusilli pasta to the top.  The atmosphere is open and quiet and the price is just right.",1,1
"We LOVE NBN! My husband is obsessed with the beef stroganoff and I almost always get the paid thai. We love the lettuce wraps & dumplings, too. We had NBN cater our wedding and all the guests raved about the food, too. We definitely recommend to anyone. We have never had bad service, and even when busy the food doesn't take long to come out.",1,1
"Service is great, good for a comfort food fix. Love the mac and cheese with grilled chicken.",1,1
"Usually one to avoid the chain restaurant or any place that screams concept, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful experience I had this evening at Nothing But Noodles on Elizabeth Avenue near CPCC.   After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a ""buy one get one free"" bowl of noodles.  We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there.   After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.  We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.  All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares.   Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",1,1
"Good and fresh served noodles. Will definitely try other items in my next visit. The noodles are delish with or without the protein, which cost extra",1,1
One of my favorites!! I love the Asian Thai peanut noodles. Its es spicy!!!! My husband got the beef stroganoff and it was great!!! The atmosphere is casual. Sweet tea is so good.,1,1
"This place makes an awesome simple salad. Asian salad has cilantro, carrots, crunchy noodles and an awesome sweet chili sauce. Full size salad is a big amount, half will probably suffice next time. I'll be making this a destination once a week for lunch in between classes! Be sure to use your student discount :-)",1,1
I'm a huge fan of NBN!  It's one of my favorite spots for take-out now that Elizabeth Avenue is finally open and free from construction.  I usually stick to the Asian menu items and I am always pleased.  The food is fast and fresh (so making substitutions and/or additions to your dish is easy) and the grilled chicken is delicious!  Make sure you order a chocolate chip cookie to round off your meal...they warm them in the oven for you.  YUM!,1,1
"The selection of food was not just limited to noodles, being that I have eliminated carbs and meat for Lent, I was still able to enjoy a tasty, healthy well seasoned lunch. I definitely recommend the Asian salad and tomato bisque soup, absolutely delightful. I also had the lettuce wrap, no chicken extra veggies. Yummy! The staff's service was spot on, will definitely recommend and return.",1,1
Spicy Cajun pasta is a must and bread sticks are almost on par with Olive Garden. Also saw Hornets star Cody Zeller here who makes Millions of dollars so its gotta be good if a millionaire goes here before a game,1,1
"My little cousins rave about Nothing But Noodles, and beg to eat there most days after school. I was surprised how good my meal was from this VERY kid friendly place. I had alfredo and added 3 veggies (only $.99), can't pass that up! My little guest had the infamous Butter Noodles...I think thats what all the kids get. lol Nice place for a quick meal, can't wait to get back!",1,1
"They were closed and welcomed us inside with open arms. That's a business doing it right.  8:07pm. The roommate and I ventured here after yoga and errands. The door was locked because they closed at 8pm. The manager came running to the door and said please come on in and order. I worked in service industry a long time. I would've never made eye contact and walked far away from the door. I know, I'm awful. Heck, we were just turned away next door at Earl's because their kitchen closed at 8pm.   There's a lot of options on this menu. The manager recommended choosing from the Asian or Italian section. He also thoroughly explained the dishes and answered all our questions. We went with the Basil Pesto (add meatballs), Spicy Japanese Noodles, Potstickers, Bruschetta, and the Spicy Cucumber Salad. Everything was good. This may sound weird, but my favorite out of all of it was the salad. I loved the flavors.   Things to know: these are pretty good sized portions for the price. You can easily make two meals out of a bowl. Noodles has a gluten free menu and is also kid-friendly. During my latest visit here, you could get a free drink if you checked in on Yelp. Parking is available on the street and in the lot directly across from the restaurant.  That's pretty neat alert: Nothing But Noodles does a lot of fundraising efforts with local schools and organizations. They've donated over $240,000 in the last eight years.",1,1
"I go to school at cpcc and this is such an awesome place for lunch. It's really spacious and clean inside so you won't ever feel crowded or feel rushed to eat your food so someone else can have your table.   Stuffed shells and fettuccine Alfredo was pleasantly really good. Service was also great and if you're a student they'll give you a student discount!   Skip out on the Lobster Ravioli, it's claimed to be spicy but it's just an overall weird overdosage of Cajun seasoning taste.",1,1
The pasta here is delicious. I like the pesto option. There are several different types of pasta to choose from. Service is very good and friendly. The cost is low given the quality of the food. I'm a regular here and will continue to be.,1,1
This place is great. If you like Noodles & Company then you will definitely like this place. This place is just better. I ordered the Spicy Japanese Noodles with chicken. This was my first time here and everyone was nice and patient with me when taking my order. Will definitely come back to this place again. Looking at what some other folks ordered I can definitely say that you can't go wrong with anything that you get here. They also have a gluten free options for their dishes as well.,1,1
We dined there Friday night. All 10 of us were happy with our food! I tried a salad for something different it was delicious and huge!,1,1
"I had to visit twice before I wrote a review to make sure what I experienced the first time was real. Well it was.  Took my wife here for the first time, promising a tasty, healthy meal. She was not disappointed. The whole building smells incredible as soon as you walk in. With unlimited choices of combos being able to add any protein to any noodle dish or salad is great. Great local art on the walls, and a general cozy feel.  You order your food, get a number ala Showmars or McAllisters. They bring it out, very happily. All the workers genuinely seem happy, which is rare.  Great spot for lunch, although might be a bit pricey but for the quality, as well as quantity (usually 2 lunches worth) it is well worth a visit to this once ghost town of a road as construction all but shut it down for almost a year.  Something for everyone, even veggies, you're missing out for not having been here.",1,1
Delicious. The vegies were fresh and the noodles were good. I was in the area and this was a good choice to try. I am glad I stopped in.,1,1
"Nice ""fast food"" style place for . It's a mix of Asian and Italian which isn't very common from what I've seen. Value is really good for the portion.",1,1
"I absolutely love this place.  My mom and I eat here at least once every time I'm home from college.  I'm a super picky eater, so the fact that they have ""buttery noodles"" on the adult menu is a HUGE plus.  I have to order off the kid's menu way too often.  I'm also 21. Their prices are very reasonable and the service is super quick! Check this place out!",1,1
"I love pasta and I love NBN! This place is wonderful and has such a variety. I want to try everything. My favorite and go to is the Spicy Cajun Pasta with Mushrooms and Zucchini/Squash. YUM! They are always so quick to get my order out. Today I was given the wrong order and before I even got to my car, the sweet girl behind the counter had chased me out to my car to tell me and allowed me to pull my car around to the back and delivered it right out to my car so I didnt have to go back in. Talk about customer service! How sweet! Their bread sticks are delish as well!",1,1
so i had a bday giftcard but it was for another noodle place she signed me up and gave me a free dessert anyway (which was the peanut butter pie GREAT) when i sat down to dine in i made my drink and went to table (i was in front) but soon as i grabed  it it wasted everywhere the lady from back came over in .2 seconds and cleaned it up. gave me a cup and silverware but wet sign out and everything she was on it,1,1
"Wow. So many noodle options. I got the Japanese noodles, which were ok. Big portion too.  Seems like this is the kid/teenager hangout, so it's rather loud.  Don't forget the Yelp check-in for a free drink.",1,1
This place has never disappointed. Good amount of food for a great price. Spicy Japanese Noodle is great as well as the rest of the menu. Enjoy!,1,1
The restaurant I originally wanted to go to was closed so we decided to eat at nothing but noodles. I'm really glad we chose to eat here. It worked out well that the restaurant  is fast casual so we were in and out fairly quickly. I had the spicy Japanese noodles with shrimp. It came out nice and hot and cooked well. It had a nice kick but was not too spicy . The veggies were not mushy and the shrimp were delicious. I love udon noodles and that was the big reason I ordered this dish. It's served with lime which adds a good acidic twist. I wish they had a location where I live in Winston Salem.,1,1
"The food was good and good portions for the price.  But most importantly, the customer service was excellent! !",1,1
Extremely happy to find a cheap restaurant with a Gluten-Free menu. I was pleasantly surprised with the number of options that I could actually enjoy. Yeah for Mac&Cheese !,1,1
"I don't know how I never been to one of this noodle only places but I'm happy I finally got to experience it at Nothing But Noodles. I bought a few Groupons for this place since any carb is a friend in my book and was excited to see what it was all about. I love the variety and how you can get Asian, Italian, American style dishes and add protein for only $2 and some change. I went with the Chicken Pad Thai since I'm an Italian girl and wanted a break from anything involving oregano and garlic. It was tasty (but not authentic pad thai like you would get at a thai joint) and a HUGE portion. I had a bowl for dinner then had leftovers today so even though it comes to about $9 a meal, it really can be two meals. They were quick with my order and it was only a 5 minute wait for carry out. And they have the big, clear to go cups (think Starbucks), I don't know why but those make me happy and any place that has those gets brownie points from me. All in all, a great place to check out if you're hungry and want something satiating.",1,1
Great food for a great price. Never actually ate in but the to-go system is pretty good and the food is always delicious.,1,1
"I am so glad that I just found out about this place now.  I am a breadstick lover and they sell breadsticks, 5 for 92 cents.  Delicious, delicious breadsticks.    I ordered the mac and cheese, filled up my water cup, found a table and within a few minutes they brought my delicious cheesy pasta to my table.  That pasta was enough for two dinners.    I will be going back here for the breadsticks, and the breadsticks and did I mention the breadsticks?",1,1
"I really like this place. Yes, it's standard noodle place, but I eat here whenever I'm in Stonecrest. Its sit down as well as take out. I'm not sure why one $ is listed because a meal and a drink will run you above $10. So it's a bit pricey for what you are getting, but I can't find noodles as good anywhere else. I always get the Pad Thai noodles with beef. I've tried some of the american dishes as well but I always go back to my favorite. Definitely give the place a try",1,1
"Despite all the crazy construction on Elizabeth Ave that never seems to end, we ventured out to Nothing But Noodles for dinner.  We had tried the chain's other location in Stonecrest and enjoyed it much more than its competitor, Noodles & Company, so we thought we'd give this closer location a try.  Needless to say, it was definitely satisfying.    I tend to steer more toward the Asian dishes because they're not something I normally make at home.  This time, I tried the Spicy Japanese Noodles.  The sauce was divine.   It had so much flavor and complemented the extremely thick noodles nicely.   And the portion size was ""just enough"" to fill me up without making me too full.   My partner tried the Southwest Chipotle Pasta.  It was very creamy and full of flavor, too.  He said it was missing something, though, so when I gave him the mushrooms from my dish that I didn't want, he discovered that's what it was missing, so it all worked out.    The restaurant also had a great atmosphere.  It was very spacious, modern, and clean.  The service was fantastic, both at the register and at the table when the dishes were served and cleaned off.  This isn't a full-service restaurant, but they do bring your dishes out to you steaming hot (yum!) after you order at the counter.    We're definitely going back...",1,1
"WOW! I can not say enough great things about this place. My brother and I went there last night (11/10/12) before a show across town at The Fillmore. I was hesitant to drive across town and recommend a restaurant that I've only been to one other time. On top of that, he tends to be extremely ""'picky"", when it comes to food.   Long story, short, we each had a meal and a salad. Mine topped with shrimp and my brothers topped with chicken. Everything was fantastic!  I would like to give a personal ""shout out"" to Luis (not sure on the spelling?) The past two times I have been to this establishment, his customer service has been above and beyond. My brother and I even had a chance to chat with him, after he cleared our table. The owner is blessed to have him.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Four thumbs up!!!!",1,1
"I love Nothing But Noodles! It may seem pricey, but I always end up bringing home left overs and adding three veggies for $0.99 or two bread sticks for like $0.50 is awesome. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered (and tasted off of other's plate's) with the small exception of their Mac -n- Cheese. Capatelli Primavera, Spicy Japanese Noodles, and Chipotle Pasta are my favorites! Yummy! I'm usually here 2-4 times a month.",1,1
"The entrees are HUGE, I normally split an entire with my spouse because they are so large. The bread sticks are literally melt in your mouth. I think the price point is really great for the quality and combinations that are available. The restaurant is always very clean and orderly as well. They do student discounts for CPCC students!",1,1
"Loved it!' Didn't think I would. I saw the menu and was gonna leave until bf said he'd try it. Glad we did. They actually have more than noodles and I saw Italian food on the menu, but that would be blasphemy as an Italian from New York to order that here. They suggest you look at menu and know what you want when you come up to counter to order. We decided to split the Pad Thai and you get a choice of meat, chicken, or shrimp to add if you want. We chose beef. We also ordered the Cucumber salad. We chose a drink and I picked a little bottle of Pinot Grigio and he chose beer. You pay, take ur number card and sit down. They bring it to your table. Let me tell you, the portions are big enough to split if you want. Pad Thai was delicious!! Perfectly cooked noodles, great spice and flavor, texture and the beef was tender enough to cut with a fork. Cucumber salad was huge and had carrots, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes, slivered almonds, and what looked like romaine, shredded mozzarella, (odd but ok) and iceberg lettuce and slaw. Dressing was Asian and light, needed a little more flavor but so good. I can't wait to go back! Great little place for fast, cheap, and flavorful.",1,1
"Been here a few times, but sat near or at the bar to dine. I enjoyed the atmosphere and food. I had the burgers, pizza or honey sesame chicken plate during my visits, to which I enjoyed each. The staff was always friendly and attentive. You can always walk to other places nearby if this place doesn't work for you.",1,1
Best place for drinks and food. A lot of fun and good times. You can meet a lot of people from different countries there very interesting. Services great all around.,1,1
HUGE RENOVATED PATIO! Smoking and Nonsmoking.. T.v's and outdoor bar! Heated as well for cool nights.  Awesome staff!,1,1
"Been here a handful of times in the last few months.  Food has always been great, staff is generally friendly, but the place could get ridiculously busy and then the service is lacking quite a bit.  Steak fajitas are excellent, and the mini brownie is a perfectly way to finish the deal.  4/5 stars because the menu is awesome, food is excellent, but the service isn't great especially when they're busy.",1,1
"Very good as usual! I love that they have added their gluten free tags on the menu and vegetarian ones as well! I had the gluten free steak And frites! It was absolutely Amazing!! The fries were dusted in Parmesan and herbs while I ordered the mushroom  sauce over my steak! It literally melted in my mouth! I wasn't very hungry, but I practically Licked my Plate lol My husband enjoyed his dinner, My kids ate all their food! We had fun scribbling all Over their table Covers and all the Tvs which have different videos playing which kept the kids entertained! The staff were good, except the wait to be seated which sometimes can be a drag... everything is really good",1,1
"A co-worker took me there for a ""going away"" dinner since I'm moving. The service is okay. Nothing miraculous but we weren't ignored either. I had the Buttered Sirloin Steak done medium with Vegetables and Garlic Mash Potatoes. The steak was perfect! Had that nice stripe of pink through the middle without getting too rare or well done and the mash potatoes were delicious and cream. Only wished that they had given more vegetables with the dish.",1,1
Love coming here. Been going there for a while now and the service is amazing. They treat you right and make you feel like home. I love the tofu fajitas and the poutine they have. I will definately still come back.,1,1
"This place was certainly busy for a Wednesday and looks like a great place to hangout. This place is known for chicken fingers according to their menu. So I got that with poutine fries. The chicken was sooo fresh and it was sooooo yummy. I also got Rickards red which I really like. I wish we have this in the US. Not sure if they had a smaller size, but they served me XL sizes. I also love the american 90's pop and r&b. Really sets a cool atmosphere. Cheyenne was also a great and pleasant server. I had a great experience here. I wish I had more time in Canada so I can return back here. This place was certainly BANGIN'!",1,1
"4.5/5. I used to be a regular here during my teens, but ultimately started to become an adult and had less time to go out. I came here once last year in July and it was as loud and energetic as I remember it.  However, this review is based on my latest visit - tonight. I had called to make reservations Thursday evening for Saturday evening for 2. I asked for the bar, but the bar is only first come first served. Understandable. When I arrived right on time, there was a noticable wait at the front with people waiting to be seated. There were people outside too, but I'm not sure if they were in line waiting to be seated either. When I walked in, I waited for the host to finish a phone call. Funny thing! My phone started ringing. He was calling me to see if I would be coming I guess, since I was there at the very moment my reservation was and people were waiting. We were seated in a booth in front of the kitchen. The music wasn't as loud as I remember, which I liked because man, my ears would ring sometimes when I used to come here regularly. My server was Alessia. She came over and wrote her name on the dining room paper, which was helpful for us to flag her down by name later. The menu is no longer a laminated flip-open menu. It's now a double sided piece of paper listing all their food. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer first.   I ordered the Lobster and Crab Dip appetizer, which was my favourite dish here during my teen years. Glad it's still there! Still as good as ever. I also ordered the Perfect Cosmo, which was good...but then I ordered the Blue Raspberry Lemonade after and really wish I ordered just that instead (and Jacked it up - add 1oz for $3.33) because it was really good. I definitely recommend the Blue Raspberry Lemonade if you want to order a drink.  My main dish was the Brie Burger, and I subbed the fries for yam fries. Yam fries were good; I love their sauce there. The Brie Burger wasn't the best burger I've ever had, and especially not for that price point ($15.94). It was decent. I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish my burger. I had a glass of chardonnay sauvignon after. Alessia was very personable and easy to flag down when we wanted to order more drinks.  Overall, quality food, drinks, and service. There was one pesky fruit fly having fun flying around my food and wine, but that's the only bad thing I can say about this experience.",1,1
Went in for a quick bite and was not disappointed much. Got the blt poutine and the crab lobster dips. The poutine was no where near as good as the poutine choices from last year. Cheese was squeaky so that was well done. The dip has always been the appetiser I order. The amount of dip seems to have diminished from other restaurants but its still tasty. Good place! Could be slightly better though,1,1
"Was a go to place for years got tired of the menu so stopped going. Seen some new items decided to go back, food was okay but our server was great and friendly. They had a special of 1lb of free wings after 5 for each guest which was amazing. They were pretty good but that's a lot of free food, we got there around 4:30 my friend was ordering 2lbs of wings waitress went out of her way to say order a pound and bring out the other lb after. Good job.",1,1
Good bar food. Sports bar atmosphere. Try the  7oz steak topped with mushrooms with side of loaded mashed potatoes.,1,1
"My favorite bar and grill! Great music, environment and bar food.   I miss the dessert with the warm cookie with ice cream, bananas, strawberries, raspberry sauce, caramel, whipped cream and a cheery on top!!! Why would you remove that? WHY?! LOL",1,1
"I love Jack Astors food, especially the pan garlic bread, it has lots of flavour and is just amazing!   On a typical Friday or Saturday there is always a wait for a seat but is never too long.   Our waitress last night was super on top of the ball, except the pop came back diet but it seems everywhere we ask for lime they assume it's diet because alot of restaurants use that to tell the difference between regular and diet.  I had the steak, it was my first time trying it, it comes with two sides, the baked potato was huge and good and the steak was OK, wasn't excellent but wasn't a steakhouse either.  My boyfriend got the steak fajita like he always does, and it was excellent. It is always a hit and miss, sometimes it's really delicious and other times it barely has the meat cooked.   I also find that MOST of the Jack locations are the same but then there are a couple who seem to follow their own ways the food is similar but not the same..  Overall, this location always seems to be great!",1,1
"With great places to eat comes great waiting times...or not so great. But i have (happily) waited 40minutes to be seated at Jacks because for a franchise there is nothing else like it. Good food, good drinks and fun atmosphere. You walk in and you can literally feel yourself de-stress. The posters help.  Try absolutely anything on their menu because its all good. I highly recommend the crab dip!! Their nachos are good too- i opt for sans chilli (too heavy) but thats just me. My faves: chicken parm & bowties, fajitas and fish&chips.   Raspberry twister in their outside patio (ahh summer) Big groups can enjoy their own private elvis booth. Its a corner booth with wall to wall elvis heads.",1,1
Great place to get your hair cut. They are students so it's not as pricy. But they do a really good job.,1,1
"So being a student, I attempt to network my way into places... I met a young lady wearing some pretty righteous bling on her phalanges and found that she is a nail tech student as well...so we got our nails done here and it turned out great!",1,1
"i go here all the time.  used to go to Aveda spa but now that i'm in a budget, i'm using this spa school instead.  i get my hair , facials and highlights done here all the time.  price is way cheaper but the quality is decent.",1,1
"I cannot speak for the bueaty school, but the actual salon down stairs is fabulous. I got my hair done by Sharon and she's a miracle worker. It took me a very long time to find a stylist who knew exactly what I was looking for. I trusted her from the beginning and her consultation was spot on. Due to her skill, she said I would be find going dark and I love it! She mixed up a perfect combination of color bot too black but boarderline brown/black. She knows what she's doing and is a fantastic stylist. I would certainly recommend Sharon to everyone who goes to Destionation Salon and Spa (not beauty school)",1,1
"I have been to other schools where students take care of their clients, but this bets them all.  The price was so reasonable!  I had a facial done by Jennifer Trull, (Esthetician) and she was wonderful!  Don't be discouraged due to the curtain divider between you and the other client.  You need to remember it is a school where students work hard for your satisfaction and gratuity.  Mainly, you can request for Jennifer who can schedule a time for you to be treated like a queen/king with complete professionalism and relaxation.  She did such an awesome extraction which made my skin feel so smooth and youthful.  I spent $15 on a facial and $7 for underarm waxing.  Who can bet that? Jennifer you get 5 star.  Don't judge what you see, but judge the quality of the student's performance.",1,1
"I currently get my hair done here. I love the place. There's not a lot of nonsense and gabbing old women, there are private rooms where you are free to gossip with your hairdresser if you choose. Facility is handsome and modern and immaculate. They offer all of the best products and my stylist, Jerry Lambert, is fantastic! I highly recommend him, specifically.",1,1
"After purchasing a Groupon ($20 for $40 worth of spa and salon services) I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the service I had received. I went into the salon for a full face wax, manicure, and pedicure. The front desk receptionist treated me with professionalism and kindness as I checked in for my appointment.   Meredith, a student at the beauty school, proceeded to wax my face and it was a wonderful experience. She continuously checked on me that I was alright and that the wax was not too warm for my skin. She was kind, courteous, and professional throughout the entire experience. Most importantly, she took her time with me and did not rush my appointment with her in the slightest. As a result, days later my skin did not break out in acne or become red/inflamed.   RJ and Nancy, both students at the school, did my manicure and pedicure. They took great care and attention to detail throughout the entire process. They were thorough in asking questions to better my experience and are friendly-easygoing to speak with.   Overall, my experience at Destination Academy is a winner. I encourage Yelpers to give this place a chance in spite of the mostly negative reviews on Yelp. The school offers economical prices for salon services and the hardworking staff and students that make this place a gem.",1,1
"This, my friends, is pretty close to the real deal.   It's a dive.  Honestly, if you are looking for a nice place that just seems ""dive-y"", check out Shady's. This is no place to take a lady.   But that's what I love about it.   Here, there's a sense of what we used to call ""communitas"" back in college. It's a sense that boundaries of the normal world don't matter, and everyone can be themselves with impunity.  And can re-create themselves into something new and different.  And boy, do some people get into that.  Anyway, I've seen people in here who looked like they had nothing to lose and somewhat acted the part. I've also seen people who reminded me that true wealth lies elsewhere than in a lease on a new BMW. Happy, secure people who knew themselves and were just living life one SSI check at a time.  And I've also seen women I was sure were streetwalkers do really good karaoke renditions of Eurythmics songs.  So know what you are getting into, then go (minus attitude) and enjoy.",1,1
Philthy Phils is now Catalina Sports Bar and Grill!.  The place is sick.  Place is all new.  The new owners have remodeled the whole place.  Huge flat screen tv's and they offer happy hour all the time!  Went there for the first time last weekend and loved it.  They have the NFL package so I am going this weekend to watch the Cardinals!,1,1
"this is our favorite bar in phoenix, we usually come a few times  a week. the bartenders are all awesome and they mix our drinks awesomely strong. also, the drinks are totally cheap. also, the karaoke on friday and saturday usually rules.  AND they finally got darts and a pinball machine back, so that's awesome. except, the pinball machine they have is the simpsons, which is super hard to get free games on. they should get addams family or twilight zone.   as far as dive bars go, you can't really top this place: divey, cheap, strong drinks, video crack, pool, darts, pinball, jukebox, karaoke, nice people.",1,1
"I'm too late! I just found out that the soul food restaurant inside of Phil's (yeah I know..sounds unlikely) has closed!  For about six months Bumblebee Soul Food Company was serving fried chicken, catfish, smothered pork chops etc.....and it was great.  Christian, the (ex) owner of Bumble Bee is related to Mrs. White of Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. Between Christian's Bumble Bee, Larry White's Lolos, and the Golden Rule Cafe,  this is the royal family of Phoenix soul food. If one of them had a pet that opened a soul food restaurant in Phoenix I would have high expectations upon entering.   Back to Phil's. Phil's is the closest bar to my house and I wind up there for happy hour a few times a month. I agree with the other reviewers that it is a great little dive bar with friendly regulars. The only drawback to Phil's is the lack of dive bar beers like PBR and Schlitz.",1,1
"This has to be the friendliest dive bar I've ever entered.  The husband HATES Karaoke, and we still had fun here.  We saw no drama, no show-offs, no meanness, just a bunch of people on a Saturday night having a good time.  The people here were absolutely gracious and friendly.  I felt completely welcomed and encouraged to have the best time possible during my visit.  I almost never sing Karaoke, because I'm bad, but I sang two songs and received a ton of applause after both songs.  If you're a singing god/goddess, come and have fun, but this isn't a talent showcase.  The patrons were dancing to the songs and having a good time regardless of the ability of the singer.  And, I was patiently waiting to use the ladies room when a gentleman asked if I would feel comfortable using the men's room because it was open.  I told him I wouldn't mind if I could lock the door or have someone stand outside to prevent someone from walking in.  He stayed outside and waited for me to finish.  SO NICE!  I will be back to this bar.",1,1
I love this place.  Super awesome dive bar.  With karaoke!,1,1
I read the reviews below and was like ehh maybe I'll stop by.. It was really the friendliest dive. Me and my girl had a great time.,1,1
"I was treated to an excellent massage for my birthday, and I cannot say enough positive things about the masseuse, MacPherson.  I have a very physical job, and have a number of random aches and pains throughout my body.  MacPherson was able to hone right in on all the issues I have, help me with explanations for why they may exist, and provide really exceptional treatment for those areas that needed help.    Another thing that really stands out is that MacPherson is extremely professional, without being dull.  I think that's a very hard combo to come across, and she nails it.  Talking to her is easy, but she's not so chatty that the entire massage is spent making idle chit-chat ;)   She checks in frequently to make sure that the pressure is OK and you're not in pain.  Top notch massage, top notch masseuse.  I'll definitely be back!",1,1
I am a huge boutique shopper and there just aren't many left.  Divas has never let me down! There hasn't been a time when I've walked into this store and left empty-handed.  The merchandise is always different and the prices are VERY reasonable . They also carry Tyler candles and I can't live without them! The staff is always sweet and there is a big ottoman in the back where you can park your husband. I love this cute little store!,1,1
"absolutely LOVE this place. after gong into Pitaya i almost canceled shopping on mill (poor quality clothes, rude poorly dressed associates). Diva's has really cute clothes at a great price. It usually shop at Bebe or Nordstroms but this store is definitely on my list",1,1
"Moving here from San Diego stunted my style because my best friend was no longer there to help me try new things at stores. So when I found Divaz I was really happy because I love to look fashionable and try new things, but naturally I'm not very good at picking out and matching stuff. This place reminds me of a spot I always went to before nights out in Pacific Beach and a lady that always picked/made me the best outfits. SOOO I have been to Divaz two times now and each time I leave with a great outfit. The staff is very helpful, and knows the stock of the store. The prices are reasonable for fashionable/trendy clothing and it doesn't seem like cheap stuff. They have bags, belts, candles, accessories and all kinds of styles from edgy to classic. Oh and they have shoes! My favorite part was that someone on the staff gave me a pair of pumps to try on my outfits with, this really gave me a better idea of what the stuff will actually look like when I wear it out. They were very nice and picked out TONS of stuff for me to try. I found an outfit I loved and purchased it for $56 bucks and I know I will get a lot of use out of it. I'll definitely be back!",1,1
"Love this boutique! I've been coming to this store and the one on mill for years now. Sometimes I find loads of stuff and sometimes I leave empty handed . But when I do find stuff I am never disappointed , and get a lot of compliments. I usually buy my going out dresses here .  I find there prices very reasonable! One of my favs.",1,1
"I LOVE this boutique.  I always look forward to my days off so I can see what's new at Divaz.  They are always getting new arrivals in and you will not be able to find these clothes ANYWHERE.  Their collections are hand picked to be unique, trendy, classy, and best of all- affordable.  Whenever I need to get a new outfit for a night out, Divaz Boutique is my to to place.  I always find whatever I'm looking for, even if I don't know what it is!  The girls here are also SO friendly and they all have a good eye for fashion.  There is NOTHING negative I can say except that sometimes they don't have a variety of sizes in a certain piece because they only get a limited quantity of everything in.  Just got home today and can't wait to go back next week!",1,1
"I am a regular at Divaz! Every time I come to Tempe Marketplace, I just have to stop by this shop! Their staff is super friendly, helpful, and have great energy. There's always something cute to get from shoes, purses, dresses, and handbags. Although prices may be steep for some items, every thing at the store is unique and well designed. A great store for trendy women with personality!   Tip: If you want something, you should just go ahead and buy it. You deserve it. It probably won't be there next time. Everything I have bought from this store is something I love and get compliments on all the time! So worth it!  **** This is his girlfriend writing this post. I was on the wrong account, but this is too funny to take down since he is at this store just as much as I am so everything is still valid.",1,1
"Best boutique in the valley! I've been shopping here for about 7 years and they never disappoint. The staff is amazing, friendly and super helpful. Their products are also very trendy and affordable! Keep it up girls!",1,1
I love this boutique. The ladies that work there are super friendly and they have a ton of cute clothes as well as Steve Madden shoes and purses. I got a cute LBD and a shirt for $60. Oh and they give you heels to wear while you try on the dresses. I love it. They also have really good customer service. We went in right before they closed last week and they didn't ask us to leave or act rudely towards us. This is why we went back and will continue to go back!  Right now they have a parents weekend sale going on: jeans are buy one get one free.,1,1
"Divaz is the perfect place to find something cute to wear out.  I have gone in there several times in a pinch and always find what I am looking for.  The owners stock their stores with cute, trendy but wearable items.  They do a great job selling the latest styles but they sell brands that aren't crazy expensive.  I like the Tempe Marketplace location because its easy to park at that end of the mall and get in and out.  Plus their staff is actually nice and super helpful.",1,1
"I've been shopping here for the past 4 years while in college. One of the best boutiques I've been to. Great customer service, very helpful, and have a great selection. Whenever I wear an outfit from here I get endless compliments.",1,1
"Great clothes, great accessories and Steve Madden shoes. Doesn't get much better than this. There is a range of prices ($30-$108 for a dress, etc). Friendly staff and a clean place. I love shopping here.  Check the ASU Student Insider coupon book for coupons!",1,1
"I loved my friend's dress on New Years...asked her where she got it...& found Divaz. I'll be honest. I have walked by before, but the whole ""divas"" with a z bothered me...so I kept walking. How very unfortunate!!!  Silly girl.  The shop is reminiscent of my favorite little boutique in Flagstaff, with lots of the ""cheaper"" quality brands I search for. I shop like a crazy person...I grab everything! The cute little shop girls grabbed everything from me straight to my dressing room...and they didn't even act annoyed!   I ended up with three shirts, a skirt and a dress...$156 something. This is the perfect place to run to if you have nothing to wear before an evening out. Steve Madden shoes, silky shirts, higher end denim and bags and jewelry...I like. A lot.  I'll be back...",1,1
"Divaz is a great boutique!  I love this place because the girls that work here are so friendly and the store is clean and easily accessible.  This location is my favorite because it's more accessible than the one on Mill, I hate worrying about parking.  Tempe Marketplace has PLENTY of parking!  The clothes are a great price and the quality doesn't reflect the low cost at all.  They also have great jewelry and shoes in the store at all times as well.  I think the primary reason I like this store is because it is unique.  They have different inventory every visit so I feel much more confident other girls won't be wearing the same outfit. :)  If you're a fan of quality and current fashion this is a great place to visit!",1,1
"Divaz is by far my favorite boutique! There is a good selection of clothing ranging from what's hot and trendy to more unique pieces. Some of it can be a little pricey, but I've found it to be pretty durable. I have clothes from here that are a 2-3 years old and are still holding up fine! Also I've gotten great deals on clearance items, so be sure to check those racks.  Their customer service is really great--the salespeople are super friendly and helpful! They always make it a point to find out what you are shopping for without hanging over your shoulder. They've given me great suggestions on outfits too! You really won't find that kind of personal service anywhere else.  Divaz also has nice a rewards system for frequent shoppers. The only downfall is that, to my knowledge, it's location-exclusive. Oh well, this is my fave location anyway.",1,1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this store! I have been a customer for years, and it's because of their great selection, super friendly and helpful staff, and that they truly do offer a one of a kind shopping experience. They are constantly getting in new merchandise, and their staff is always there to help you however you may need. They take the time to get to know their customers, and I think that truly says a lot. If you are looking for something specific, they will help you find something to cater to whatever you need, or make suggestions on outfits or accessories. They also have a shopper's rewards program, so you can earn rewards for future purchases! This is always a go-to store when I'm need of something for any occasion really...and I'm constantly receiving compliments on my outfits that I get here. It's actually a joke between my friends that 9 times out of 10 if they ask me where I got something, it will almost always be DIVAZ! They have three locations in the Phoenix area and one in Tucson, so they are always willing to check stock in other stores if you have your heart set on something and they don't have your size. I love shopping here, and will continue to as long as I can. I love supporting a local business that really does it right.",1,1
"LOOOOOVVVEEE this place!  The staff is always super sweet and helpful and the clothes...the clothes are always on trend and to die for and reasonably priced.  As a boutique owner myself, I just absolutely adore this store!  The only downfall it is super small when it's busy and really hard to navigate without knocking everything over everything but that's a good problem to have.",1,1
This store is great! The customer service is always excellent. The merchandise changes weekly... Some days they have so many great items in all sizes but other days it's a hit or miss. I love their wide range of prices as well.,1,1
"My friend and I came here for a trunk sale for Shawl Dawls earlier this month.  Ill be honest, I thought this place looked like a hoity toity boutique that probably had a snotty staff, and overpriced merchandise. Well, im currently eating my humble pie. Their staff was sooooo nice. And their merch, while being a tad on the $$ side, is well worth it. Their set up is sort of akin to Charming Charlie, in that its mostly by color. They also have some really fun jewelry on display. I ended up returning the next day to buy a blazer and some skinny pants (that actually fit right!) that I'd looked at during the trunk sale. The friend that went w/ me to the trunk show commented that this is going to be her new party clothes place, though the pieces I bought were more business casual. In other words, they have a wide selection.  Cant wait to get paid again so I can go back!",1,1
Good place for lunch. The salad bar is really good and they have a great selection of soups. Also have pasta and breads that are very good and of course top it off with a couple servings of ice cream. Stuffed,1,1
"We go to Sweet Tomatoes around once a month. It's very family friendly, as I have a 19-month old, and she seems to love eatting all the fresh veggies. It's a bonus that we do not have to pay for her yet.   Today was the first time I can remember going to Sweet Tomatoes without a coupon so we were a little surpirsed to be dropping $27 for soup, salad, and bread. Typically there is a coupon in the paper every week so take advantage of looking there first if you like to save a buck like I do.",1,1
"It's about as good of a salad bar as you're going to find anywhere, and far outclasses SouperSalad, who remains their only near competitor.  When I've taken my time and thoughtfully combined ingredients, I've had some wonderful, tasty low-cal and low-fat meals at Sweet Tomatoes. Of course the temptation is to just pile stuff up on one's plate, and that's what most people do. Usually that just leads to indigestion and negates the whole ""health"" aspect. I've done that as well. Shamefully. Regretfully.  The cost can be reduced with coupon (that seem to come in every Sunday newspaper) and by foregoing soda, juice, tea, coffee. It's a lot of good quality food for $8-$9 per person presuming you can get by with water. Do you really need a Diet Coke?  During my visit today at this location none of the complaints I've noticed from other reviewers applied. The help was very attentive, my tray and used plate were collected quickly, and there were plates and additional silverware near the hot food.  The turkey noodle soup was tasty, and all of the salad ingredients were fresh and of a high quality. Compare that with the typical SouperSalad where everything tastes shot through with nitrates or something.  So yeah, it's usually a good experience.",1,1
The service was great and the staff was friendly. Phillip helped us and he was awesome. I highly recommend it.,1,1
"For getting a healthy dinner that's quick and inexpensive, you can't get much better than this place. Loyal customer here.",1,1
Love the food and gluten free options they have available. Clean place too. I love the dressings and soup.,1,1
"My husband and I just moved to the area, so we are going out to eat A LOT!   This place was one of the first new places that we tried after moving to Arizona. If I could, I would eat here every day.   The first time that we ate here, we entered through the wrong door. The nice girl at the register helped us by showing us how to go through the salad bar line. After going through, she gave us a free bag of cookies and some coupons for being first-timers!   The salad bar is amazing. The cashew/broccoli salad... WOW. The soups are always great! I love the mini pasta bar area and my husband loves the cornbread. I am usually too full for dessert, but I have had some a time or two. Again, amazing.   The staff is always friendly. They fill your drinks, take your plates, and ask you how your food is.   We signed up for their email program and get coupons.   See you again soon, Sweet Tomatoes! :)",1,1
"I have been to many of the Sweet Tomatoes locations and have always been extremely satisfied with their food, selection, and service. This experience was better than the rest. The manager Mike was super attentive and willing to not only answer questions, but make recommendations, assist in almost every duty, and I don't think he stopped smiling the entire hour we were there.  The food was exceptional, especially the corn chowder, and as always the salad bar was spectacular. Food, service, cleanliness, this location is spot on a great place and we'll definitely be visiting again.",1,1
"I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.  The salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons. It's clean and inviting. The soup bar, bakery have a nice selection. It can get quite noisy, but I'm here for the food.",1,1
"I am back! The foods still greats, the services awesome and now they have beer and wine..lol!",1,1
"Love Sweet Tomatoes!!! We have gone to the ahwatukee location multiple times and have never been disappointed. The kids love it too and actually want to come here over everywhere else. The food always taste great and the staff is always friendly. They will offer you cookies, refills, pick up the dirty dishes right away, and are asking if you need anything throughout your meal. For it being a buffet, I think this is a huge add on because I have been to other buffets where the service no where near matched sweet tomatoes. I seen on previous posts that some people were upset over not many meat options except for in the soups, but honestly I feel like reading the sign is pretty self explanatory. This is suppose to be a healthier option- and meat is not the healthiest. If you are looking for a filling meal that kids will love too, this is the place! Oh, and the rosemary soup is AMAZING!!!",1,1
"This is an all-you-can-eat serve yourself establishment.  Excellent very healthy food choice, reasonably priced.  Always fresh food, always very good.  Some of the soups are a bit heavy though.  Often somewhat noisy, dirty tables, mediocre atmosphere, usually very crowded with people at every table and sometimes milling around the food but, the pros greatly outweigh the cons.  Fairly good service but, it varies.  If you want the table cleaned before you sit down, someone isn't far away. Despite a usually very busy place, the staff makes a good effort to get the tables clean for the next people and they are usually not far away - always watching to clean another table.  They're usually pretty quick and the business keeps enough staff on hand, which is good.  I am sure people notice. Kids friendly - I think that is why it is somewhat noisy.  We usually sit where it isn't too noisy.",1,1
"Probably the best salad bar restaurant I have been to.  They have a great selection of items and everything is fresh. They have a few prepared salads if you are not in the mood to build or just want to use it as a starting point.  My favorite section though is the soup bar.  They always have a great selection to choose from, no matter your mood.  My favorites are the chili and of course the Sweet Tomato soup.   The staff is usually friendly and not a nuisance like they can be at some buffets.  There is always someone circling the floor with a basket of cookies.  Definitely a favorite of ours when we lived in Phoenix.  I wish they were in PA and MD so we could visit again. If you are looking for a quick healthy meal (with the not so healthy always available) look no farther.",1,1
"I like Sweet Tomatoes and I love this location. The salad bar has fresh veggies. I like the salad of the month too. Yes the dressing is too much but I don't mind it. The salad toppings and dressings are too many to select from. The soups, baked sweet potatoes, bakery section, pastas and deserts are sooo good. The cookies they serve are moist and good too. On the whole I love this place.",1,1
"This place has consistently good salad, soup, and food and is a good healthy place to take the family esp. to get the kids used to eating their veggies!  My wife and I are very happy dining here and it is a good value esp. if you are on their email list and get their coupons.  The only trouble you might have is eating too much!  Eat the right amount and feel good after leaving here because you just had a healthy meal.  As far as buffets like this go, this is one of the best ones of its type.  Much better than the competition!  The only reason we give it 4 stars is because there could be more variety with some of the non-salad food and desserts.  Other than that, it is wonderful salad dining experience.",1,1
I love going to Sweet Tomatoes! You can fill up on healthy foods and the taste and flavor is awesome! Their partner in California is Soup Plantation. The choices are varied and delicious....We will always be a fan of Sweet Tomatoes!,1,1
"Sweet Tomatoes is a cozy spot perfect for those who like to build their own salads. There are so many different foods to add to your salads, everything from peas, to nuts, to many salad dressings, you could fill up just on that. However, to their credit, they have warm foods in a different section.  Several soup options are available in breads and soups. You can also choose pizza slices and macaroni and cheese, which is great if you have kids with you.   To top it off there is jello, other desserts and self-serve ice cream. A nice selection of beverages meets you after the cashier area, closer to the salad fixings. The booths are sized nicely and it is always clean and bright.  Nice spot to eat healthy without sacrificing options. Staff is limited but they have nice attitudes and helpful. No problem recommending this eatery to others.",1,1
This place reminds me of the old chain Fresh Choice that used to be in California...exact same setup and just as delicious! I really like this location compared to the one in Mesa.,1,1
"Sweet sweet Sweet Tomatoes. This is one place I absolutely adore above all restaurants, chain or non-chain. Everything they offer- be it salad fixins, pastas, pizzas or desserts- are always fresh and varied. They carry a few house salad dressings that I absolutely adore. The pizza bread is also very unique! Never have seen it anywhere else. Overall this place is amazing simply because they have so many simple things and can cater to a lot of different tastes.",1,1
"I am a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes but usually visit a different location but I like the warm colors of this one and the layout of the seats. Additionally the food was very good as was our server. My favorite dish was the albondigas locas soup which was slightly spicy but flavorful. The Wonton happiness salad hasn't been on the salad bar lately but you can ask for the salad dressing and make your own. Sign up club veg and they will send coupons and update you on the variety of flavors, dishes and specials every month. Right now they have their red lava cake starting but only at dinner. I don't give 5 stars because the meat has been removed from the salad bar nada the foccacia bread was put a few times we went for refills but I will be back to this location for sure.",1,1
"Always good to come here. Chicken soup is their classic all time favorite.  Easy going atmosphere, good for dinning alone or with family.  Food is healthy but can over eat easily... Worth signing for coupon emails",1,1
Great place to eat with the family! The food was very good and the staff were all polite and friendly. The bakery items were a bit hard but we went towards the end of the night so will definitely have to give the baked goods another try. Prices were decent for a buffet.,1,1
"Yes, I am a fan. It is similar to ""Fresh choice"" in California, but I like the variety and freshness of the dishes. The salad bar is the same, so I won't go into to much detail about that. We like to go on Sundays after church for lunch.  What I do like is there soup bar, 5 to 6 different types of soups are very delicious ranging from (chicken noodle, clam chowder, Irish potato lech, spicy chili bean, minestrone lentil),   Fresh baked goods are refreshed every hour. Corn bread, blueberry muffins, pizza, french rolls.  They have a stir fry section, which changes daily depending on breakfast lunch or dinner. I personally like the cheesy macaroni. They have Baked potatoes with all the fixing's.   The usual dessert par includes: fresh fruit, jello, pudding, chocolate/ vanilla soft server.  bonus; on occasion a server will come by with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.  One thing I noticed though, is even though this place is suppose to be healthy. All you can eat doesn't help from gorging myself.",1,1
"This place is everything I love wrapped into one. Salad, soup, bread, and desserts. You can build your own salad or select a pre-made salad. Unfortunately you cannot go back through the salad line...so stock up! Soup, breads, and desserts are unlimited. I would go back for sure!",1,1
"I've been to many Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes locations, and this was the best!  The selection was good, all items were fully stocked, but best of all, everything was fresh and the restaurant was clean!  Staff was among the friendliest I've seen at a buffet.  Yummy!",1,1
"The trouble with corporate chains is that they are all the same.  That's true with the good thing about them as well.  I guess that's why we support them with our business.  There's few surprises... and there's none here.  Nutritious soups and salads.  I'd give them 5 stars if they kept their menus heart healthy, but they've caved into the demands of over-weight Americans.  There's plenty here to clog your arteries and pack on the pounds.",1,1
"I have never been to a restaurant with such KIND people! The woman stocking the salad bar was so friendly when we walked in, the woman at the register helped talk us through everything with a smile, and the guy walking around giving out cookies is making sure everyone is happy. Wow!",1,1
"I love Sweet Tomatoes. This place is always clean and really has good food. There salad choices are endless and there broccoli salad is awesome! It has cashews, raisins, sunflower seeds,sugar and mayo in it. It is so good but I just found out it has almost 50 grams of fat per serving so I'll be laying off that. They also have great soups, a warm chocolate lava dessert that is to die for and good pizza and hot steamed veggies. They also come around and deliver hot baked chocolate chip cookies to your table. Sign up for there newsletter/birthday club and you'll great coupons delivered to your email. They also have a breakfast bar on Sundays I believe but I've never tried that.",1,1
We come here every weekend. The food and service is always amazing! This place has been a tradition in our family for years. We started going here after our local Souper Salad closed. They're very similar. Many healthy foods to choose from! And there is pizza and Mac & cheese for kids. Great place.,1,1
"The food was really good tonight.  It is always clean and that is unusually for a buffet.  I love that the table helpers walk the floor to clean your table & offer refills.  They ALWAYS have a smile.    I love that they have fresh veggies including fresh bets, not just the picked ones.  Though I really dislike the tarragon tuna salad...GROSS!   I love to take a pasta dish and use it to put a baked potato in it so I can top it with cheese, chili & sour cream.  I also use the same pasta dish for dessert...cookie/brownie on the bottom then ice cream on top.  Much bigger than the ice cream bowls they give you.",1,1
"This is the second time dining at this location. The good is fresh and, fir the most part, very healthy. Lots of choices for all kinds of tastes with the exception of meat. Great selection of soups, salad fixins, pasta, baked goods... Highly recommended. Go online and check for coupons to save yourself a few bucks.",1,1
"Simple, good food that can accommodate many different dietary needs.  Good place for small children as there are a lot of finger foods (beans, peas, corn, noodles, etc.). The salad bar area is pretty clean.  They have a harder time keeping up with the bathrooms on weekends because they are packed.  Tables are cleaned fairly quickly to keep people moving through.  We are regulars and like almost everything we try there.",1,1
"So I would be lying if I said I was excited the first time my friend suggested eating here. My thought process is, why spend money on just a salad bar but boy was my mind quickly changed. There is something for everyone. The health conscious can fill up on the salad bar while others, like myself will hit the soup line as well. Their chili is amazing especially with sour cream and cheese. I always say I will try ""that"" the next time through but I never get to the next time through. They did lose a star for the price. 2 bucks and some change for a drink? I quickly forget about that once I start eating because it tastes so good. I never thought I would consider eating here a reward for good deeds but it definitely is.",1,1
"I love this place! The food is so good and I don't know if you can call their food healthy, but it seems healthier than other restaurants. Except the fact that you can stuff your face as much as you want to! My only complaint is the price, but I guess you can say that you have to charge that much for a buffet. I love the fact that they change their menu every month. Their soups are so delicious; I particularly love their onion soup. Also their pastas are very good, as well as the baked goods like the lemon or blueberry muffins.",1,1
First experience at this location wasn't the greatest but all the food was fresh. Second time I went the service and food were both great. Great place for lunch or an easy dinner.,1,1
"All of my family and I went here yesterday when they opened.  Their were 21 of us.  The food was mainly fresh, but there were a few items in the salad bar that didn't look fresh.  The cucumbers didn't look good either, like they were from a couple days ago or they sliced up bad cucumbers.  A couple of the salad dressing items didn't have ladles so this made it a bit challenging to get dressing.  My kids used the dressing cups, but if everyone did that, that would be unhygienic.  Same thing with some of the other items like the seeds & croutons.  They need to have serving utensils for this.  Service, however, was fantastic.  We had a couple of servers for our table and they regularly took our plates away, refilled water, stuff like that.  Since it was early, the rest of the foods, the hot foods were fresh.  Wish there was a great dessert selection, but I can't really remember if they normally have so little in terms of selection to offer.   We were able to easily use a coupon from my phone for $8.99/adult with drinks.",1,1
"My daughter really wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes.  After some prodding, I told her we could go, but I wanted to find out what was behind this instance that we have Sweet Tomatoes for lunch.  What did she hold to be the very essence of Sweet Tomatoes that was driving her to say that we must go?  Here is my interview.  Interview with my daughter.  Me: What  do you like about Sweet Tomatoes?  Mira: The dessert and the pizza.  Me: What else do you like?  Mira: The food.  Me: But, why do you like coming HERE?  Mira: Because .  . . Of . . . the FOOD!  Me: Is there anything else you like besides the food?  Mira: The drinks.",1,1
"First of all, fabulous name. That's what enticed me in in the first place, as well as the fact that I am absolutely obsessed with buying stuff for my dog even though he always plays with the same ball day after day.  Doggone Purrfect sells clothes for pets, shampoos, potions and lotions and toys, as well as beds and blankets, and pet food. Everything you could ever not really need, to be fair!  I saw a Furrari dog bed in the shape of a, you guessed it, Ferrari, but it was well over £50, so I opted for a chew toy and some treats instead. Great wee shop for all your pet needs though!",1,1
"Great wee shop! Get all of my furry related stuff here. Not the biggest shop but always has exactly what you need, from things to keep the animals warm to entertained, fed and transported!!",1,1
New fast food addition to downtown. The workers were all really friendly. We only ordered a drink and cookies. The dining room is small but a good use of space. Hopefully the small space will stop teens from loitering (like wood st McDonald's for example).,1,1
"This store is wonderful.! My boyfriend and I decided to get on a phone plan with each other, and decided to go with Verizon instead of TMobile or AT&T, which is who we were in before.  We stopped by the store on Tuesday night, nick ran some numbers for us, and everything looked so good, we decided to go through with switching services right then and there, even though we originally planned on just stopping by to run the numbers and think about it. We never felt pressured to sign up, or felt like he was trying to talk us into a sale. He was just letting us know what was available, what it would cost, and left the rest up to us.  We ended up having to order both the phones we wanted, which I understand, no big deal. And our phones got to the store in a day and a half.  Once we got to the store to pick them up, nick was extremely helpful and helped us get everything set up perfectly.! My boyfriend was having issues getting his phone number ported over, due to incorrect info, so we ended up having to spend about 3 hours in the store.   Never once did Nick seem irritated or annoyed by how long it was taking, even though we didn't end up leaving until about 4 minutes before closing. He was the only one working, and was able to help a few customers between helping us, and never broke a sweat.   Ive worked retail the last 10 years, and I know how frustrating it can get sometimes when you're about to close and there's still people in your store, but never once did he make us feel like we were unwelcome, and even told us he would stay open as long as it took for everything to go through the way it was supposed to.  I love the service we were provided with here, and we will absolutely be coming back to this location, whether for issues or just to upgrade in the future.",1,1
"Great store, excellent service! David was extremely helpful to us, with a good sense of humor. We had a fantastic experience!!!! I recommend this store to anyone.  Verizon is great, David's service makes it greater!!!!!",1,1
I have been with Verizon for years and been in several other stores as well as dealt with Verizon on line customer service but have never received the service I did here!  I went in to add my son back to our family plan wanting to change my cell phone from iPhone 5 to either the new larger screen iPhone or back to the galaxy note.  The salesman really took his time walking me through the options of both phones and helped me make the decision easy to move to the new Galaxy note.   He also helped me find a great deal on a tablet for my son for Christmas!  Finally he looked at my plan and told me I could save money moving to a different package for my data and got me additional gig of data to my plan for less!  As I watched his team work with other customers I realized I will not work with the online team anymore I will go into this store for all my needs! They really cared about the customers and were a ton of fun making the time fly by as we waited to complete our transactions!  Thank you so much for your professionalism and EXCELLENT customer service!  Stephanie Burden,1,1
"I can't say enough good things about this store and its awesome crew!    My father and I had just left the Verizon corporate store on S. Power Rd completely frustrated and confused after trying to upgrade his 3-year old plan and phone when we were fortunate enough to stumble on this GoWireless store!  The corporate store was less than helpful.  The corporate employees were very impatient and short with us, refused to take the time to explain anything to my father, who is very analytical, and did everything they could to pressure my dad into a more expensive, high-data plan without explaining how he might benefit from it.  After all, he only averages 0.3GB of data per month!  Our questions were met with sales pitches and simple ""no can do"" answers without offering alternatives.  Somehow, the first associate we spoke with got on the topic of tablets and data plans, while my father and I were still unclear about what to do with his phone.  All in all, there was simply no eagerness of the staff to really assist us as people and it became clear why the corporate store has you ""take a number"" when you come in.  Yet, just one day before our very disappointing experience with the corporate store, I had visited a GoWireless Verizon retail location in Scottsdale when I convinced my sister and her fiance to upgrade their phones while we were out at lunch together.  That was the first time I had ever heard of a ""GoWireless"" Verizon location and, although not a Verizon customer myself, I was impressed with the attention and service they received from the staff there.  One of the associates at the Scottsdale store even drove across town to another location while we waited to get the phones we wanted because it was a popular new model and they were out of stock at that location.  I found the customer-oriented service refreshing and in stark contrast to what I observed at the Verizon corporate store!    So, as my father and I left the corporate location the next day, ready to pull our hair out, ""GoWireless"" was the first thing that came to my mind.  I looked online and was surprised to find a location very close to us on N. Power Rd.  I drove my father up there and, to this day, we are very glad we made the trip.  It was evening when we arrived and close to closing time, but the staff was very inviting.  We were first assisted by Thomas, who was extremely helpful and took the time to not only write out the price breakdown of each plan in a way that my father could understand, but he also researched other plan changes that could actually benefit him based on his specific needs.  He even put a popular phone on hold for him, since it was the last one at this location and we would have to come back another day to finish the transaction.  When we returned to the store a couple days later, Thomas was there, along with Terry, the store manager, and another associate.  All three were actively helping people and answering the phones.  It was quite busy, but the staff remained upbeat and cordial with everyone, including us.    When it was our turn, Thomas remembered who we were and took the time to go back over all the plan options with my father a second time, which put my father at ease.  After that, both Thomas and Terry again looked over the proposed changes in detail before submitting them to make sure they would best fit my dad's particular needs and ensure he was getting the best deal over the long run.    In the end, my dad walked out with the new phone he wanted, a 25% savings on his monthly bill (without having to give up any services) and a big smile on his face!  I couldn't ask for anything more of a retail store, corporate or not.    If I ever switch to Verizon (and my interaction with Thomas, Terry and the rest of the crew have me considering it), I will be sure to stop by this location again.  Go here for your Verizon needs and avoid the corporate store hassles.  Thanks a lot, guys!  Keep up the good work.",1,1
"An absolutely beautiful gym with pretty much everything you can ask for in one spot.   Nestled within DC Ranch, walking up to the Village is like entering a luxury resort. The professional staff greets you cheerfully as they scan you in.   You descend to the luxurious locker room areas where your membership card serves as a key for your daily locker. The locker room is stocked with everything you need to get ready for the day post-workout - showers feature shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shaving cream, and even razors. Fluffy white towels and washcloths are plentiful, and there are vanity stations complete with hairdryers, flatirons, curling irons, q-tips, cottonballs, mouthwash, and makeup mirrors.  Stop by the water station on the main level to fill your cup with ice and water to take with you while you work out.  Once you hit the gym-floor, the options are endless. Upstairs is an extensive cardio area with ellipticals, stairmasters, and treadmills. There is also jogging track, a Kinesis area and TRX area on the upper level. The main floor has a basketball court, racquetball courts, and a weight training area with a few hidden surprises like a Curve treadmill (not electronic and VERY challenging) and Jacob's Ladder.   I've attended several group classes including Pilates mat classes, Interval Training, Kinesis, and Core, all of which have been challenging and fun. The trainers are friendly and helpful, providing good instructions. The equipment is in good condition and is plentiful.   The cafe has some great healthy options for a post-work out meal, although they also offer some pretty tempting non-healthy options as well (Pizza, chili fries, cookies) which are tricky when you're trying to burn off those calories :)   Features I haven't yet used are their childcare (which I hear is wonderful), the salon and spa, and the pool.   The gym can get a bit crowded during peak hours and I've had a few workouts that were derailed from my original plan because there were group classes taking place in the area I planned to use (ie. the weight area) but the nice thing is that there are so many options that it's not too tough to readjust.   The Village is one of the few places I can say it is a pleasure to work out :)",1,1
"First Class.  Love this place.  I just need to stop eating at all the best restaurants in town, and spend more time in this place.  Seriously, staff is great.  Classes are really good - and hard.  Equipment and amenities first class, top notch.  Go see the 2012 Manager of the Year - Chris Warmbold to belong.  Tell him I sent you.",1,1
"I am glad the village has a track to run on and a pool. The bathrooms smell nice and fresh and the food is good in the cafe most of the time. Also it has towels provided so we don't have to always bring ours. Well we could do that because we shouldn't always rely on others or things to work for us. Well but that's sometimes nice once in awhile. It is nice and air conditioned inside and I find it cool that the locker room has a hot tub, sauna, and steam room and for sure the bathrooms have showers, of course",1,1
"This club is nice.  There's basketball that is surrounded by a well planned floor.  I see this as Gainey Village 2.0 - a slightly better version.  They work out rooms are designed for each purpose (cycling and Yoga with others I haven't tried).  They yoga room has stars in the ceiling that sparkle.  Such nice improvements to the pool area, upstairs lounge, locker room and cafe where they merge it with the atrium area.  If I retire ever, it'll be here.",1,1
"I don't love being at the gym, but if I'm going to be at a gym, this is it for me. Absolutely top notch. Very clean, beautiful, and such a friendly atmosphere. I have been going here since I moved to Scottsdale 2 years ago. I love that there isn't much turn over. I see the same friendly faces all the time. There is definitely a family feel to this facility. The kids facility has so much to offer, the locker rooms are great, the yoga classes are offered often with a nice variety of teachers, the  personal trainers are excellent, the spa is so pleasant and peaceful. There are an abundance of cardio machines and there is quite a variety of weight equipment. There is a also a good variety of group classes with fun and well trained instructors. Lastly, I think the cafe actually has some pretty good food.",1,1
"OMG!! This is the BEST gym I have ever gone to!!! :) :) :) Here's why this Health Club is the BEST: - In a VERY nice area (DC Ranch in Scottsdale, right next to Silverleaf, a housing community with 32 million dollar houses!) that looks like a community out of a book! - FRIENDLY staff!!! :) The staff have been nothing but NICE to me and my Mom!!! :) - In EACH locker room, there is a huge cedar wood and eucalyptus sauna, a huge eucalyptus steam room, and a huge nice and hot Jacuzzi!  - The locker rooms are over the top CLEAN, have electronic flushing toilets (so you won't have to walk in on an unflushed toilet!), have spacious and hot (or cold, if you want!) showers with shampoo, body wash, conditioner, shaving cream, and shavers, and the locker room also has vanities with lotion, hair gel, spray deodorant, hairspray, hair combs and brushes in Barb-I-Cide (a hair styling tool disinfectant liquid) hair dryers, flat irons, round brushes, and hair curlers, cotton balls, cotton swabs, cotton pads, and lighted makeup mirrors, The bathrooms have time-of-the-month stuff (pads and tampons and a proper disposal box), and the lockers have keys that lock your locker and you carry around (to activate the locker, you have to stick a card with holes in the locker key place, just ask for the ""locker card"".)  - The pools are the heated to 86 degrees Farenheit Family Pool, the chilled to 82 degrees Farenheit lap pool with 6 lanes (!), and the splash pad that is on in the summer! There are PLENTY of lounge chairs with either massive umbrellas or shade, and tables and chairs if you want to sit, have a smoothie, and talk with your friends or family.  - The Veranda Cafe is AMAZING with great food, good smithies, iced tea, ice cream, snack bars, cookies, popcorn, and Coca-Cola soda products.  - There is FREE, UNLIMITED, COLD, and FILTERED water and ice with cups, life and straws (also for free) available!!! :)  - There is also FREE and unlimited coffee and Nestle coffee creamer (in Hazelnut and French Vanilla), along with FREE sugar, and lemon juice packets (for your water).  - There is a kids care center that gives the kids their own mini sport court and an area for babies! - The upstairs workout center has treadmills with TV's, a yoga room with a light up blue and ""a sky full of stars"" ceiling, (reference to the Coldplay song ""A Sky Full Of Stars""!!!)  - There are also a HUGE basketball court,  racquetball courts, a track, and a full-service Spa!!! I would only complain about the steep price (1,400 dollars for the joining fee, and then 250 dollars a month!!!) :( 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!! :) :) :)",1,1
"The tennis center is the best in town.  I'm learning my way around the health club, but most of the time, I just hit the tennis courts!",1,1
"If you haven't been to Diane's spin class you are in for a treat. Excellent, variety of sessions taught by a professional with good medical background and great sense of humor. Diane keeps up on latest information about exercise and benefits to you. The facility is constantly updated with latest equipment. Staff is excellent. Everything is also very clean",1,1
"I love all the Villages.  Finally settled on DC Ranch since it was closest to my house.  For awhile, I was going every day since I was training for the Tour the Tucson.  Since I was going there every day, I noticed quite a few things~ the friendly staff regardless of the hour or time of day, the diligence in keeping the health club 100% clean without feeling intrusive, and everyone I came across was a pleasure. I saw weight lifting equipment that was out of order fixed by the next day.  Spencer and Kevin Shephard at weight lifting really know what they are talking about, Mandy Campbell was great to work with on the pilates machine, Chris Warmbold is great in membership.  And the members were always friendly to me. The amazing thing about the Villages as I have experienced not only at DC Ranch is that the environment turns working out from a chore to a pleasure.  For this I'm thankful. If you want to go to a place not just for working out but looking for a community as well, this place is for you!",1,1
Wow. Here on vacation and my aunt and uncle took me to the village. THE BEST!!!!  Arizona knows how to do it.,1,1
"Honey lemon black tea is really good, place is clean too. When you eat in they serve you a little bucket of fresh butter popcorn. Service is a little slow though.",1,1
"I love their customer rewards program and their drinks.  I have yet to do more than a drive by pickup though.  The atmosphere is wonderful, you walk in and are hit by the cosy pub feel.  I love it!",1,1
"Service is quick. It's a perfect place if you are looking to chitchat with your friend or talk about our school project or assignment. Bubble tea was delicious, salt and pepper chicken was delicious too. Keep up the good work. I will recommend to everyone who likes bubble tea.",1,1
"I was looking for a place to get my nails done while visiting Sun Prairie from California and was recommended this place by my aunt. Wasn't expecting a lot since I didn't see a lot of yelp reviews on it. But this place is great! Workers are great, friendly and very gentle. They really take their time with you.",1,1
New owners are much better than I had originally thought.  Place is always spotless and the always do a great job.,1,1
I love this place for grooming and the great selection of foods/toys/bones/supplements for my dogs.  I am glad there is a pet store in my area that I can trust.  The staff love animals and take good care of my dog during his grooming.,1,1
No complaints. They do a decent job. It's pricy and booking is tight.  I've since switched to a cheaper place nearby  who does the dame for 40 bucks less.  Still I must say they do a good business in the Guild and are consistent.,1,1
Colleen is the groomer at muddy paws. She is always very friendly and helpful. I have a crippled pomeranian and they are always very gentle. They clearly love animals and will do their best to make you and your furry friend happy! Great service :) afterwards they even send you a cute pic of your pet and put a cute bandana on.,1,1
We loved this hotel and it's a great discovery.  Very well thought out space in a great location.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  Parking is an issue and the front stairs are daunting for anyone with a slight disability but there are good restaurants and bars literally in the same block.  I felt bad that we only had one night here as we felt right at home and cared for.,1,1
"No complaints really, it's a great place to stay in a cool area. I have no complaints, I came here with a car and they set me up with directions to a lot that was not too expensive and the room was clean enough, a bit plain but who's here to stay in their room?!",1,1
"Overall, staying here was pretty good. For me the highlight was the location, in the heart of the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood, on the main thoroughfare of Rue St-Denis, easy walking distance from so many fabulous places to eat (and the main reason I come to Montreal is to eat!). It's not a bad walk to downtown, either, or if you prefer it's right in between the Sherbrooke and Mont-Royal metro stations, a few minutes walk to either. For such a small and simple place there are quite a few amenities - croissants every morning, kitchenette and coffee maker in our room, complimentary bottled water and orange juice. There was free wifi, but as our rooms were in the far back corner, we couldn't get a strong signal and could only use the wifi while in the hallway. The main reason we stayed here was because we could get a 2-bd suite for a reasonable price. The suite didn't have a common living room area, it was basically just 2 regular rooms attached to each other, but it did have a nice little outdoor porch. I'm sure it would have been much nicer in the summertime, but we didn't use the porch much since on most days it was raining or snowing. The beds were murphy beds, so if you wanted more space you could put them away, but unfortunately we found them extremely uncomfortable for sleeping on. After 5 nights we were definitely looking forward to going home and sleeping in our own beds. I'm not sure if I'd stay here again, but it's certainly a nice contrast to a big hotel, the prices are reasonable, and like I said, the location is great if you're looking to hang out in this particular part of town.",1,1
"I've stayed at Anne Ma Soeur Anne twice now and I always think of it as quite the bargain. The first time I visited Montréal, I stayed at one of Delta's properties, your usual corporate/salaryman hotel. Needless to say, it was underwhelming.  On the other hand, Anne Ma Soeur Anne has done all the things right. For example, at the Big Corporate Hotel™, there was no free Wifi access and even worse, not even a fridge. Little Hotel That Could™ had both. Anne Ma Soeur Anne is nothing fancy but all I'm looking for in a hotel is a clean place to hang out and watch some television (or surf the internet) while I relax from a long day of sightseeing. While it's not fancy, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms. The daily croissants left at the door are cute and if you have a room that's facing away from St-Denis, you really have no idea that on the other side of the hotel is one of Montréal's busiest streets.  My favourite thing about this place is its incredible location. It's within walking distance to many of the areas of Montréal I usually hang out in (Plateau, Mile End, etc) and it's close to a ton of great restaurants and shopping along both St-Denis and The Main. Not to mention that La Banquise is a very short walk away for that drunken three in the morning Poutine snack.  Highly, highly recommended and a great value for a hotel. Just don't expect a flat screen HDTV, room service and an in hotel spa treatment centre and you'll be fine.",1,1
"I'm a fan of this hotel and am in complete agreement with the previous reviewer. The location is awesome and you couldn't ask for better. I studied in Montreal for 5 years so when I go back I'm interested in going to the best bars and restaurants in the city...these places are minutes away from the hotel.  In addition, the daily croissants are super tasty and much appreciated. The room is cozy and kept clean, water and juice are provided daily for free (it's the little things that count!).   All and all, you can only be impressed that you're getting this for dirt cheap.",1,1
"Well, what do you expect from McDonalds anyway? This location has pretty fast service, even on the week of their free small coffee. This is a plus for me considering I am on a rush to catch the GObus to York University, so I am able to grab a quick coffee before rushing back to the bus shelter to wait for the bus. Haven't had any rudeness here either.",1,1
"Friendly staff, located inside the mall at the lower level. Always get my order right, and if they mess up they always fix it immediately and compensate for it. Always busy as it's in the mall but extremely busy during luncThe only con I could say to this location is they do not have a self serve drink station.",1,1
"Dr. Barefoot is awesome and so is every last member of the team there. Dr. Barefoot is a life-long athlete and an area youth coach as well. Personally, I am so happy to have a Chiropractor who understands an athletic lifestyle and the rigors it places on the body. My body is consistently racked in one way or another. He's the fix-it man. The two reviews which speak of poor service, are from uninformed people who should educate themselves before posting reviews. Chiros send people for x-rays to ensure there isn't damage which could be made worse by manual manipulation. Barefoot is a great doc, but he can't see inside of your body like Superman. I am also positive his comments to the young lady had no malicious intent. It wouldn't be at all possible a teenage girl maybe misunderstood what he said or his intent? Did mom bother to call the Doc and ask him? No. But she found the time to post a slamming review which affects his practice and livelihood. I'm a chiropractic connoisseur. I've seen 11 different chiropractors in two different states. He's the real deal.",1,1
"Dr. Barefoot and his team are wonderful! Dr. Barefoot is very thorough, and very knowledgeable.  He is dedicated to giving his clients the best possible care.  I would strongly recommend him to anyone in need of an excellent chiropractor, he has made a huge difference in my life!  Amy Coy D.V.M.",1,1
I have been going to Barefoot Chiropractic for four months and I haven't felt this good in years. The staff know me by name and treat you as a friend from the moment you walk through the door. I was recommended by a friend to visit Dr. Barefoot and it was the best choice I had ever made in regard to my personal health. This business is a jewel in East Mesa!,1,1
"This is My Fav, Local Bar, This is my ""Cheers"" Where I get to know a lot of other locals and have a good time with never a worry. prices compared to other places I have gone are nice. Happy hour I think is 4-7pm and 12am-4am where things are half price. The Bartenders are cool and not afraid to chat it up. there's 3 pool tables a dart board and they have a beer pong table, with plenty of seating. Sat Night at 10pm-2am is Karaoke always fun. There's no food here but they let you bring in food.",1,1
"This is the best local bar that I've been too. I've been coming to this bar for about 5 years and they've always been fantastic. Many reviews that you read on this page is comical because they're reviewing the Pts on Charleston down the street from here. The 3 main bartenders at night are Andie, Stephanie, and who we all like to call princess. If you want a good time, they'll give it to you. It's laid back and if you want it poppin come in on Saturday when they karaoke with my boy Mr. Edd",1,1
"""Why review P.T.'s?""  My reply......""It's a Vegas staple.""  Honestly, these day's P.T.'s is like Starbucks, there's one on every corner. It's the place you go when you wanna get a casual beer down the street from your house.  Or the place to watch the game without the hassle of going to a sports book on the strip.  It's Cheers, but in Vegas.  The Sahara location was right behind my apartment, I could hop the wall and be there in seconds.  Honestly, when you just wanna hang out and let it all hang out this is the place....easy.  Ain't nothing wrong with a giant iced and frothy mug of anything on tap.  Why be picky at a P.T.'s.  SO....you don't wanna wait in line after getting all dressed up to go to a club?  You don't wanna go to a sports bar buried in a casino?  Look out your door and I bet there's a P.T.'s Pub within spitting distance.  See you there.",1,1
"They shortened the happy hours at these bars, so happy hour is actually almost an actual hour now. More corporate greed at work. They did have a few beer specials, like 5 buck tall bud lights,  so that made it workable. Ordered the bikini wrap which was pretty good for a wrap. White chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Choice of wrap like spinach would have been nice. The fresh Cole slaw almost stole the show...The cook must have cut it up after I ordered. Best slaw in awhile. Good switch from fries. Not a bad location. Good living room area which I had all to my lonesome watching game.",1,1
Really laid back and nice dive bar. Their wings are AMAZING. best I have had in a very long time!!,1,1
One of the better Pts I go to. Oliver is  a good bartender and is on point when it comes to keeping your glass full.  Wish they had their own food and didnt have to go next door though. Also pissed I cant bet sports here anymore but not there fault.,1,1
"Complimentary bathrooms! Free water! What more can u ask for???    Always fast service! Great happy hour and they play the games you want to see! Its very lively and the bar staff is excellent!   They dont serve food like other PTs but they let u bring in food from next door....Don Tortaco!   Pool tables, juke box and fast women always available...",1,1
The food was absolutely amazing the service was very quick fast and upbeat I will definitely go back and recommend it to all my friends,1,1
"This is definitely my all time favorite bar. This is the after work hangout for all of my friends and I. It's got the best bartenders, the best drinks, cheap prices, and good times all around. They've even got clean bathrooms, complimentary water and soda. And, if you've got the Touch tunes app you can play music on the jukebox. Can't forget Karaoke night on Saturdays starting at 10 PM. Plus, you've got don tortaco next door, so you can get drunk, pop in for some Mexican food, came back in, eat, and then drink some more. What more could you want? Also, it's really sad when people want to post incorrect reviews and lie because they drank too much and got mad their tab was too high. Shout out to my favorite bartenders Andie, Stephanie, the gorgeous Tony, and Tony with the good butt!",1,1
"Place is a little dated, but definitely a good place to have a drink, play some pool or just meet up with friends. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but I was surprised it was larger than I thought on the inside. May be my husband and my new place Monday nights.",1,1
"After a night of bowling, my friends and I decided we needed food in our systems! Thank goodness we came during happy hour!  HAPPY HOUR: Half off all drinks and pizza from 4-7pm & 12-3am!  WHAT: Since our favorite pizza wasn't on the menu (The Gilroy), we all came to a consensus on what we wanted on our pizza! The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!  We also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!! Gotta love me some curly fries!!  & lastly, had to top it off with the Pear Cider!! This has become my new found favorite drink!! I know, it's girly, but I LOVE IT!!  *NOTE: The service was great!! The bartender made it so easy for us to order, and had a great sense of humor! I love people with a good sense of humor. It just brightens my day! =D",1,1
"Great bar, great atmosphere, great staff!  By far my favorite PT's location in town.  They have 3-4 pool tables, darts, and a golden tee machine.  Also an internet jukebox where they won't skip your music if you put on a little death metal (I HATE bars that skip songs- why have a jukebox in the first place??).  I was there on a Saturday night, when they have karaoke weekly at 10pm.  We had an awesome time!  There's a HUGE seating area down front with plenty of room for the karaoke singers to do their thing.  Also, unlike many karaoke bars, it was VERY upbeat.  Most karaoke places just go through the list of singers all night, with silence in between karaoke songs while waiting for the next guy to get up.  Not this place.  There wasn't a moment of silence the whole night (DJ would play instrumentals in between songs while waiting for the new singer to come up).  Also, in between rounds of karaoke he would play popular upbeat music.  There was a crowd dancing to the Cupid Shuffle and Cha Cha slide!  You don't see that at Ellis Island, that's for sure!  It was definitely the kind of atmosphere where you could have a great time even if you're not a karaoke fan.  The best part is that all drinks were half priced from midnight- 3am.  The karaoke normally goes 10-2 but the host stayed almost until 4am because people kept tipping him to stay.  Definitely a great place to party- I'd highly recommend it!!",1,1
"The food there was awesome! Very authentic and great experience for my taste buds... Love the concept of conveyer belt sushi on floating boats, but sort of disappointed with the limited choices - not many people were there throughout our dinner, and the expensive dishes that no one wanted to take just stayed there forever, and I almost felt like taking down some dishes just for them to replace with new ones... Everything else was perfect, the environment was nice and quite, the service was good, and I'll definitely revisit.",1,1
"I had a really good time here.  I sat at the bar with 4 others and we watched the boats go around, choosing which plates to eat and which to let sail on by.  (I don't actually think they were sail boats).  Food was good, better than I expected actually.  The chef's in the centre were talkative as well when you asked them a question.  Very good service here.",1,1
We just landed from Montreal and came here right after our check-in. The Hyatt hotel recommended this place as this is our first visit to this restaurant.  Absolutely delicious fresh sushi. The chef and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this place.,1,1
"Was here for dinner, we sat at the revolving sushi table. The design of the sushi table was really unique, they used boats that float on water to move around the sushi plates.  The sashimi was pretty fresh, but it only had sashimi, niguri or sushi rolls.   So besides picking dishes off the sushi table we ordered off the menu too. We ordered scallop sashimi, ebi and sweet ebi. Additionally we ordered softshell crab, sirloin steak and skewers  Everything was pretty good except the skewer, first time we ordered it. It was soft. Second time we ordered it, it was hard, dry and chewy.   Besides that it, decent restaurant, nice design. Recommended to come for the experience.   Price: Pricier side Food: Good Service: Good",1,1
"I'm a west coast food snob, and I'm here to testify: this place rocks.  Best hamachi kama I've ever had.  Spicy tuna rolls that were all about the big chunks of awesome tuna and weren't a blended-into-oblivion mess of tuna and mayo.  Service had a little trouble getting started, but then was quite polite and attentive.  A little pricey, but I think that's par for the financial district.",1,1
"So I finally came to what was previously the only sushi boat place in TO. This is very japanese, people, so get over thinking this is cheap quality fish.  Although with a party of 4, I didn't want to sit at the boat, so I ordered from the menu.  Started off I was starving waiting for my friends, but I gobbled down that marinated eggplant amuse bouche. I moved on to some more authentic japanese food once we all were settled. A plate of tofu served cold with bonito flakes and ginger is authentic, but the waitress made sure I knew what I was getting. Perhaps a few people were expecting Chinese-style fried tofu?   A few of us wanted just sashimi to 'see what the place was made of'.  So, I shared the 16 piece chef's platter of sashimi and was so glad I did.  For $28, you can't buy that much excellent quality at any downtown fish market. It was all excellent.  However the rolls were really a miracle of tastiness- spicy hatote (scallop) roll was my fave, but the vegetarian dragon was cute and delicious.  Between the four of us, we ended up with two ""bottles"" of sake, 300 mL each, so really like splitting less than one regular bottle of wine. The sake we got was the unfiltered genshu kind and was decent, but not on the menu.  The price per person? $44.  With more food than we could all finish, two appetizers and half a main, this was a great value!   The minus one star is for the service - we had to ask for water 4 times and it came around the same time as the bill.  Also, we had really wanted to fun place on Saturday night and we had to listen to not one, but two awkward first date-esque conversations because there wasn't enough background music/conversation to drawn out the silent moments at their table.",1,1
"The draw are the sushi boats moving by you in a moat, but the sushi itself, ambiance and overall experience is quality. You can just grab the plates as they go by, or order off the menu....or both. Be careful...some of The plate colors have different prices. I had about six different plates off the boat, and ordered 3 more items and a seaweed salad a la carte...nothing disappointed. This can be a nice $30 meal...or a $130 meal depending on how hungry you are and what plate combos/drinks you choose...be forewarned!",1,1
"Great lunch-time spot, it's become a go-to spot for my business lunch meetings.  Quiet even when it's busy, very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, contemporary decor.    Sashimi is really fresh and amazing, my recommendation is the Tako, Hokkigai and the Unagi.  The Scallop entree is also very tasty.",1,1
I've been here a few times with my family.   service is very good.  appetizers are very good. the main meals are not bad but not as good as the appetizers.  the salmon sashimi is just fantastic.  the udon soups are fabulous.  great broth. the chicken or even the vegetable one are both great tasting.   the little tiny bowl of cold appetizer they give u when u sit down is just amazing. its cold marinated bean sprouts and carrots with egg and toasted sesame.,1,1
"Arriving here for a late dinner with a big party, the staff was accommodating and polite.  We had a seat at the sushi boat which was enjoyable.   The plates are priced a bit oddly, for example the salmon sashimi plate which has 3 nice, thick pieces was the same price as the salmon nigiri which only had 2 pieces of salmon which were rather tiny.  The sushi quality is superb, and the rolls were delicious.   We had a very enjoyable dinner here.",1,1
"Ask to be seated at the bar when you walk in!  This is the only conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Toronto (according to my friend who's a Toronto native). The cool thing about this place is that it doesn't even use a conveyor belt to rotate its sushi dishes. It's a stream of water with sushi boats floating on it rotating around the sushi bar. Such a cute idea!  The sushi, however, is pretty expensive. You're paying more for the experience than the food itself after all. Plates range from $3 to $7 and each plate only has about 2-3 pieces of sushi or sashimi.  If you don't like what's rotating or have a specific request, you can ask the chefs to prepare something for you or order something from the menu. My friend and I split about 7 plates of sushi and ordered a dragon roll off the menu. The total came out to about $35pp, which wasn't that bad since we're converting from USD. It's definitely worth trying for the whole rotating sushi experience.",1,1
"Came here on a Thursday at 5:30.  We were the first ones here at the sushi bar and surprisingly wasn't too busy even when we left around 6:30.  Let's start with the pros: - The atmosphere was fantastic!  The big draw is the sushi bar with floating boats that travel around the bar.  I think this is definitely worth going to see. - The quality of the food was also amazing!  The sushi was all very fresh and of high quality, the chicken yakitori (a must try!) was moist and flavorful, and the tempura was flakey and not overly heavy. - The service was very professional.  We were greeted when we got in, promptly attended to during our stay, and everyone thanked us as we left.  A few cons: - Very pricey.  Ordering a mix of sushi rolls, appetizers, and sushi/sashimi from the sushi bar came to over $50 per person.  And we didn't order an excess amount of food. - The sushi comes with wasabi.  I don't much care for wasabi and since they give you your own dish of wasabi, I feel that they should play it safe and not put wasabi directly on the sushi. - Each plate from the sushi bar is color-coded with the price.  It took me a little while to memorize how much each plate cost.  They have a pricing guide that rotates with the sushi but you'll have to wait for it to come back around if you want to see it.  Overall, I recommend trying this place at least once.  This restaurant is very high in quality and the sushi bar boats were a lot of fun to see!  However, because of the price, I don't see myself going back unless it's for a very special occasion.",1,1
"I have been searching far and wide for a place in Toronto with a conveyor belt sushi bar. So far, I have only discovered Fune, in the heart of downtown.  The sushi bar here is not a conveyor belt, but rather a chain of floating boats rotating in an infinite loop. Same idea. A variety of sushi roll pieces, sashimi, and other things pass you by. You simply pick what you want from the boats--the price per dish is based on the colour and pattern of the dish.  The food is okay, but mainly it is a very fun and esoteric dining experience, which can get expensive quickly if you are not paying attention to what you are picking. There is also a menu if you prefer a traditional table experience.",1,1
"I'm obsessed with the Sushi Pizza!!! It is delish and everytime I'm on business in Toronto Fune is a must visit.   I have never been disappointed with anything else I've ordered and the service is always outstanding.   I usually sit in the main dining room and I love the red and dark wood walls. I have yet to take a seat at the cool sushi bar, where wooden boats of sushi float around....maybe next time.  I love you sushi pizza!!",1,1
Best sushi and sashimi in Toronto by far. The freshest you will find anywhere. The floating boats are awesome-o too.,1,1
"I love coming here, I never have a bad experience.   If this is going to be your first visit, go there with an open mind and know it's a little over priced. So if your watching your wallet just walk out. You're paying for the nice environment, nice service and your experience, so just relax and check your cheapness at the door.   Each time I go the service is great. The manager makes sure you don't wait too long for anything. I always sit at the sushi bar, I like watching the little boats pass me by as I eat. And if there is something that you want but isn't passing by, they take orders upon request. I'm obsessed with their shrimp tempura udon noodles. Something in their broth is addictive and soooo delicious. Service can be a little too attentative but always on point.   This restaurant is a great treat once in awhile to spoil yourself and I definitely recommend for a date night or something different and fun.",1,1
Service and a la carte food was great. The sushi on the river conveyor belt can sometimes be there for hours so be wary of that.,1,1
"There really are not many revolving sushi places in Toronto, so this makes for a very interesting experience.  Instead of a conveyor belt they have boats that float around the sushi bar.  The selection on the boats is a basic assortment of sushi roll pieces, sashimi and some other miscellaneous items.  Although I went with a platonic friend, I would highly recommend this place for a date night.  It is definitely an interactive dinner.  We went on a weekday for dinner and found that the place was quite busy, which means that the food on the belt was fresh.  The plates on the belt ranged from about $3-$6, and it was nice to be able to immediately start grabbing the dishes and not having to wait for the service to come around.  I'm not impressed with the dessert menu, I think they could have more Japanese desserts.  I skipped over their selection of cheesecakes and other generic western desserts.",1,1
"I come here for lunch frequently, like 2-3 times/week because its really close to my office and the lunch specials are good. The restaurant is clean, service is quick+efficient+friendly and the food is always fresh. It gets extremely busy during lunchtime so come early. Sometimes I get takeout and its really fast, around a 10 minute wait. :)",1,1
"Food was top notch, fresh, and delicious. Ordered the Sashimi Dinner ($30) and a glass of wine ($12), and it is definitely not an overpriced restaurant for what you get. I wasnt able to finish all the sashimi.  The environment of Fune is romantic and relaxing, they play soothing music and the decore is subtle yet high end. Service was fantastic, refilled our water regularly, checked up on us every 15-20 minutes, and followed up with us about getting more food and wine. We arrived at 9pm-ish on a Wednesday so the dining area was empty except for us. Maybe that is why the service was great? But no complains. Will go back again.",1,1
"I always loved the place but it was great to go there with my whole family, my son was happy with the floating boats and being able to choose what food looked great. My Eastern European father who is a meat and potatoes guy really enjoyed the beef/rice meal off the menu - there were intricately carved veggies into flowers, meat was well seasoned and good. I also liked pulling off the boats the delicious food :) Overall, great experience, a bit pricier but given the location, great service, decor it is worth the money because it is an experience.",1,1
Sushi River that spins around like the movies! We sat at the bar and grabbed a ton of dishes but then realized how expensive it can be. They do have an A La cartr menu you can order from which sort of saves you some money if you are planning on devouring these fish like a Shark!  I ended up ordering some terriyaki chicken with my Sushi and it was delicious!    The sushi is fresh and yummy as well and this place is definitely worth a try! Just make sure you bring your fishing rod to catch the flying fish...haha! Kidding...all you need is fast chopstix skills and you will be fine!,1,1
"I've been here a couple of times and the place is always nearly empty. Strange though, as it has some of the most delicious sushi that I've tried in the city. Though offering only a small selection, the sushi items are expertly crafted and very good. There's even an old style rotating sushi belt, which, I hear, is fairly uncommon these days.",1,1
"Really liked this place! Having lived in Japan for 4 years, I was missing Japanese food and this place helped! We didn't opt for the conveyor belt sushi but ordered off the menu. Everything was amazing! The place has a nice atmosphere and staff were super friendly. It's not cheap but it's worth the money. Will definitely be returning!",1,1
"Great, friendly service, some of the best & freshest sushi I've had.",1,1
"I OWE this place a review! I had come here by accident a little while ago whilst I was in Toronto for the weekend. My friend and I were FLOORED by how good everything was. First, we were greeted immediately. We sat at the sushi bar (we were the only ones) but there was a cute boat sushi, kind of like a conveyor belt. As soon as we walked in, there were so many new dishes coming out. I felt special that they were making all those dishes for us. Needless to say, I was almost full before my Oyako-don came.....but I ate that too and kept eating from the boats. Everything was wonderful. The staff was attentive and even spoke with us in Japanese through the whole visit. I felt like I was in Japan again. Anyway I would DEFINITELY recommend this place for anyone who wants real Japanese food. My only regret is that I couldn't take this place back to the US with me!",1,1
"Love it!!! The fish is so fresh!! And the food looks so beautiful. Great romantic evening on the mid range budget. We had 2 apps, 2 enterees and 2 drinks was about 60 bucks.",1,1
"This place is really good. It's nice environment, you'd expect to pay a lot for a meal, but the first time I came here for a work farewell I had the sirloin steak for 10$. I go almost every week for it. It's one of the best steaks I've ever eaten (consistent every time) and super cheap and a nice environment.",1,1
"I went with two young men (10 yrs- and 13 yrs old) at the 13 year old's recommendation. His family had been before and loved it. From the moment we walked in and were greeted warmly by Norman, shown to our seats and had meticulous explanation about ""how it all worked"" we had the greatest time.  The sushi chefs were attentive and helpful. The other nearby diners around the boats were delightful. The wait staff was not intrusive but always at the ready should we need anything.  We sampled from the boats, ordered two beef udon: best ever! Broth of heaven, beef from the gods, leftovers packed up and accompanied by take-out utensils.  Freshest fish, great presentation, an experience not to be missed.",1,1
"Kaiten-zushi is such an exciting way to experience different types of sushi with friends. I'm really glad that Fune remains one of the very few restaurants in Toronto to still offer it. We were there for a birthday party recently and while sitting in a half circle around the belt, far away from each other was not the most ideal set up for in-depth conversation, it was quite a lot of fun.  The fish was fresh and the variety of offerings was large. It was interesting to compare tasting notes while some of our party tried new fish for the first time and to share suggestions of our own favourite dishes to others as they came whirling by. There were so many colours of plates (which indicate the price of each dish) that it frankly got too confusing to keep up with. Despite having given up on keeping tabs though, I was pleasantly surprised to find that we hadn't racked up as enormous a bill as I had feared.  Besides seeing all the sushi go by, it was also fun to watch all the faces poking in from the street level windows outside. The service was courteous from the moment we got our hot towels upon being sat to the moment we were given our separate bills and greeted good-bye.",1,1
GREAT food and GREAT service. The food was very fresh and their tempura wasn't over fried. Recommend it to anyone in the area,1,1
"Sushi was fresh. Can't complain. It was good stuff. Waitresses were nice to fill up the glass without having to be told. Service was ok, not much wait time. Floating boats were what we got sold to get in so order mostly sashimi as its better.",1,1
"This is one of my favourite, reasonably priced Japanese restaurants in the city. They have a wide variety of maki rolls, sushi and sashimi, and some great options for those diners who are not yet ready to delve into the raw fish!   This place has a great atmosphere, and it has many tables and a sushi bar with floating boats. We have never had a problem getting a table at this place and have always had friendly service.   Generally when I go out for sushi I get an appetizer of tempura veggies with shrimp - this is done very well here. And then I generally order one other item off the appetizer menu along with a variety of maki rolls. What makes this place stand out above others I've gone to are the spicy scallop rolls they do. I've gone to some places that won't even do scallop rolls, so that's what makes this place stand out for me.",1,1
"This is one of the first ""good"" sushi places I found in Toronto. It's located underground and depending on when you arrive it can be busy or empty.   The most popular feature of the restaurant is the kaiten style conveyor belt; kids love it and often there are no spots available around the belt.  I prefer the sit down area and here waitresses are very attentive (perhaps to the extreme). There is a manager who watches to make sure the service is quick and efficient; she gives ""the look"" if they are not. For glutinos: they can obsess about making sure there is no gluten in your meal.  The food is pricy but good. Fresh, presented beautifully with many unique creations. I'd definitely go back.",1,1
"So after getting our Blue Mountain on we decided to drop by Toronto for a spot of lunch. After a bit of research on the Internet, yelp, and some brainstorming, we decided to give this restaurant a go. Dropped the address on Waze and off we go.  We get in right about 40 minutes before closing time which is understandable, they close around 2 pm so the sushi chefs have already started packing up. Whatever that was left on the boats were pretty much what we're having for lunch.  I like the artistic nature of their plates, specially the sashimi plates garnished with shizo and daikon. These guys know what they're doing. Plus the nigiris, or whatever that was left was pretty good too. The tea was hot and the water was cold.  The host was very accommodating and attentive, so are the wait staff. We'll come earlier next time so we can take their full arsenal of sushi plates for a spin.  Thank you Fune! I'll see you again next time.",1,1
"Fune is probably best known for their sushi boats that circle around the center bar of the restaurant.  You can simply pick up any dish you like and pay the fixed price based on the colour of the plate.  Some decent options include scallop, squid and uni.  If what you are looking for isn't displayed in front of you, there is also a regular menu to order from.  When I am not craving sushi, I often order their $10 sirloin steak, served with a miso soup, white rice and sautéed vegetables.",1,1
"They are located on the lower floor of a building. We came here specially to experience the revolving sushi table. The design of it was pretty unique. It wasn't the typical conveyor belt type of sushi table. Instead they had wooden boats that floated around in circles.   Came here on a Monday, the place was not half full.   The design of the place was very simple. The typical Japanese type of feel to it. The waiters and chefs were Japanese and spoke Japanese. Communication with the waiters was okay, not too difficult. They were able to understand what we wanted properly.   First, the sushi and sashimi that ran along the revolving sushi table. The plates ranged from around $3-$8 I think. Each plate consisted of 2-4 pieces of sushi or sashimi depending on what you get.  They have maki sushi, sashimi, niguri and some desserts.    The sushi was pretty fresh, again, they serve sushi mildly chilled-room temperature which I'm not used to. But it was still pretty good.   We also ordered sashimi from the menu since it provides a greater variety of fish. The sweet shrimp and scallops were really good !    Additionally we ordered beef skewers, each order came with two skewers. The first order of skewers we're really fresh and the meat was soft and flavourful. The second order was really hard and chewy. It tasted overcooked. As for the third order of beef skewer, it was soft again. It  was a little disappointment.   As for dessert, we had mochi, dorayaki and a green tea tiramisu. The mochi was soft and chewy and was filled with red beans. The dorayaki was okay. The green tea tiramisu was not that good. It tastes a little stale. The texture of the cake was dry and not moist.    I would've given the restaurant a 5 star rating since everything was almost perfect except the fact that we're some food flies flying around the table and the quality of one of our orders wasn't that great.   However, overall it was a good experience. Will come again!",1,1
"Great restaurant!  Hamachi sashimi is absolutely the best I've ever had. It melts in your mouth like butter. Ordered one dish, and ordered another straight after. Rib-eye teriyaki is also fantastic. Philadelphia roll was OK. Banana Crepes left you wanting more. I had hamachi sashimi at Japango literally the day before - Fune is *much* better.  Atmosphere and service are fantastic. Strongly recommend!",1,1
"Best albacore sashimi I've ever met. The ambience is really nice. You have a choice to be seated at a table or booth or at the very unique river ""moat"" where sushi floats on by. This place is very consistent with excellent quality fish and service.",1,1
"Excellent high-end sushi restaurant with a well-implemented boat system. Really good quality on all the sashimi and signature rolls. Atmosphere was quiet and upscale, and service was good. Pricing was slightly on the high side but nothing too outrageous for a sushi place in downtown.  Unfortunately, the menu pricing was hard to understand. $12 for ""Dynamite"". Does this dynamite plate come with 4 pieces of maki? 6? Jumbo or small? So it becomes very difficult to anticipate if the value is worth while. Turns out it was four jumbo pieces. And this was odd; two pieces of salmon nigiri or three large pieces of salmon sashimi. Both for $5.50. Clear winner there, but a little odd nonetheless.  Either way, service was great, even for a 9pm sitting. Fune is open about an hour later than most of the other sushi places nearby.",1,1
"Authentic Japanese sushi, so fresh and flavourful! The staff are friendly and efficient, always making sure your needs are met. The decor and music is soothing and seating is very comfortable. Try the sushi pizza, it's the best I've had anywhere!",1,1
"The food at this place is very clean. You can sit at the sushi bar and have the choice of picking up the plate from the  sushi bar or ordering stuff on the menu.  I really enjoyed their beef tataki and spicy tuna. It can get a bit crowded during lunch time, so would recommend trying the place for dinner.",1,1
"Fune's sushi bar is fun and delicious! Whether you are new to sushi or consider yourself a connoisseur, this place won't disappoint! Salmon and mango roll is unbelievable!",1,1
Good food and great atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Bit pricey but you get fresh tasty food.,1,1
"This place boasts one of the most traditional decors with a large sushi bar with floating boats going around in circles.  I've mostly been to this place for lunch but I've been on a few occasions on a date in the evenings for dinner.   For lunch, they have a special lunch menu.  Most of the things that I have tried have been good. The salmon or teriaki ribeye.  I did try their noodles - it was tasty but nothing too memorable.  As for dinner, I've always ordered a la carte.  The hamachi, ikura, uni, and salmon have always been fresh. I've also ordered the spider roll. It tasty but only comes in four pieces. I've had better spider rolls elsewhere. They have good oysters - 3 for $6.  The prices are ok - $15-17 for lunch and $40-$60 for dinner.  Its a great place for casual business lunches. The service is good and fast.  Reservations recommended for lunch.  As for dinner, the food it of good quality, albeit pricier than other places. Its a solid place to go to if you want a la carte.  However if you are looking for specialty rolls, menu items, or interactive sushi chefs, this isn't the place for that.",1,1
"Conveyor belt sushi. It's a novelty (and more than a little gimmicky) but definitely worth a try. It is with this mindset that I went to Fune one night for dinner after seeing decent reviews online.   The ambiance is fantastic. You sit at the sushi bar where you see the chefs making the platters of rolls, sushi, and sashimi fresh in front of your eyes. The little boat conveyor belt is a nice touch, since it definitely gives a little more oomph to your meal to see little boats carrying your sushi around the sushi bar rather than your standard conveyor belts that you expect to see in a factory. Definite bonus there.  The fish was very fresh and very tasty, melts-in-your-mouth goodness. The chefs take a lot of care with the fish, and it takes them a great deal more time and effort to make the sushi than I had expected. The rolls with the sesame seeds rolled right into the rice were fantastic. Being able to choose exactly what you want and just grab it off the little boats was a really great experience.  One downside: nothing is labelled. Which means that if you are trying Japanese food for the first time, or you're not familiar with a certain dish or fish, you actually have no idea what you are eating. Since the chefs are always busy, I personally didn't want to interrupt them to inquire what I was having, which leaves some question marks as to exactly what I had just put into my stomach, no matter how good it tasted. Then again, ignorance is bliss.  While it is a little on the expensive side, especially if you have a big appetite since the price starts adding up faster than you'd know, it's a worthwhile experience if you are looking into trying conveyor belt sushi.",1,1
"I went here for dinner based on a strong recommendation from a hotel. The place didn't seem very inviting from the outside, but it ends there. They have a boat bar as well as nice cozy tables. The ambiance is soft with traditional music and is actually pretty romantic with the servers dressed in kimonos.    The service was impeccable and the sushi was fresh and very good. The pieces on a few of the rolls were a little too big but I am not sure if thats a complaint :) I had a really good time and look forward to going here again.",1,1
"It was already past 10 by the time we arrived in the area to celebrate a friend's birthday later that night. (We wanted to try Yuzu No Hana but sadly, they close an hour earlier than Fune on Friday nights.)  We walked by Fune and saw the conveyor belt, and we just had to try it! I've had conveyor belt sushi a few times in Hong Kong and have always loved it. I knew it could get a bit pricey but neither my boyfriend or I have tried it in Toronto.   We sat at the sushi bar where we could see the chefs preparing the sushi and sashimi. It was near closing so there weren't many choices, nor were the chefs putting many new dishes out. We just picked up whatever we liked from the sushi boats. The plates usually just sit on a conveyor belt, but at Fune, the plates are placed on floating sushi boats, which is kind of neat. However, the plates are not labelled. There is a set of plates that is labelled with the prices, by the colour and pattern of the plate. But they don't provide you with anything in hand that you can always refer to; whether it's the name of the dish, fish or price.   Besides the conveyor belt sushi, we also ordered a chirashi sushi dinner and a tonkatsu dinner. I really enjoyed the chirashi sushi. It was nicely presented and the fish was very fresh and tasty. For this reason and this reason only, I would return to Fune! Besides that, for the price we paid for the tonkatsu dinner, we were surprised at how big the portion was (compared to the prices at Mississauga's Korean/Japanese restaurants). My boyfriend enjoyed it so much, he finished it before I could try another bite.  Despite being the last ones to leave, the staff was friendly throughout. The ambiance and decor was really nice. It's a little classy and a little romantic. It was nice since we were both dressed up for our friend's birthday celebration later that night anyway!  We will definitely be returning to Fune, and I think next time, we'll be dining at a busy hour when they have the most items on the conveyor belt. Looking forward to it already!",1,1
"I only ate at the sushi bar (conveyor belt sushi) instead of doing the a la carte and eating inside at a table, and I am so glad I did.  PRESENTATION: They replaced the industrial looking conveyor belt with a motorized stream of water that flows at a quick pace, where wooden boats that are hooked onto each other travel down the rotating stream, carrying two plates each. Each plate is covered with a plastic cover, so that it remains hygenic while it makes its rounds along the bar.  PRICING: Plates range from $3 to as much as $7 per plate, and each price point uses a different plate design. You will see sample plates with clearly labelled pricing in a trail of boats, so do not worry about not knowing the price of what you eat.   PORTIONS: Each plate generally carries 3 tiny pieces of maki or 3 pieces of sashimi or 2 nigiris (sushi). The plates can also carry a small portion of Japanese dessert.   THE GOOD: Beautiful interior design, great service, great presentation by replacing the conveyor belt with the stream of boats. Pricing is very obvious, and they are not trying to trick you with prices. Most of all, it a lot of fun to watch the boats go by, and watch the empty spots  being replaced with different nigiris, makis and sashimi. They have quite a selection hidden up their sleeves. Your eyes will be very happy. You almost feel like a child, because you are thinking that you should grab that plate before it disappears! You feel a little regretful if you did not grab something the first time and you are waiting for it, and you realise it is gone by the time it comes back to you because someone else took it! For me, it was all part of the fun.  THE BAD: The quality of the food. Sashimi was not fresh, and in fact, it was warm. When I ate it, the flesh of the fish was not at all supple and it tasted of nothing; meaning it was not fresh. Makis are also not very good...I tried the spicy tuna...it only had avocado and tuna, and as someone mentioned before, the spicy sauce was literally mayo and sriracha mixed together....ew.  Also, they do not label anything, so if you do not know much about sushi and Japanese desserts, you are in a bit of a pickle. Another thing is, you have to go at the right time, which can depend on the day. I went at 7, and there were only a few people at the bar. By the time I left, more people had come, and that is when it started to get really fun, because dishes disappear quickly and they are putting out new things you have not seen before. I was kind of angry that when I was there, they were putting out all the same ordinary things like tuna, salmon, escolar, and when I was about to leave, that is when they started putting out more variety, like mackerel and eel. I do not understand why they were saving the eel all this time...it is very popular...  I would say this is a great place to go with a date or for a fancy birthday dinner for 2 or 3 people. I would honestly never come back here unless I wanted to wow someone with the novelty of sushi on a boat and fancy decor and superior service, because the food was honestly below average. However, I give 4 stars because they are executing something that you cannot find elsewhere in Toronto. It is worth a visit, and for me, it was worth the price for the experience (not the food, though).",1,1
"Good experience! I've been to two conveyor belt sushi restaurants in Japan, and this brings back some memories!  I ordered toro sushi on the side (not from the boat), and it was pretty good, though the ones I recently had at Yutaka and Japango were slightly better and fattier.  I was also surprised to see some medium toro sashimi on the boats. Those were delicious! 7 dollars for 3 pieces per plate. Pretty good deal!  I grabbed 2 plates of Uni (2 sushi per plate, 7 dollars per plate) from the belt. For the price, the portion size was decent. The uni was also pretty fresh, although the recent one I had at Japango tasted better (but for 10 dollars for 2 pieces. It also had more Uni.)  One downside to the conveyor belt sushi experiences is that a lot of the same stuff keep circling around. It feels to me that if some pieces keep circling around and people don't grab them, the chef should swap them with different ones. Of course, you can always grab the menu and order stuff a la carte, but I would have preferred seeing a more variety of sushi and sashimi on the boat.  I also ordered a tempura udon on the side. The broth and the udon quality were excellent.  Service was also very good. The waitresses were very attentive. As for the price, it was a bit on the pricey side (as expected), but we were here more for the experience, which I feel was worth it.  Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (not an average).",1,1
"Fune is fune-tastic!  I just got back from a great lunch at the sushi bar - also known as the moat or the conveyor belt of goodness. It is the only sushi bar that I know of in Toronto that has the floating sushi boats.  What I love about this place is the freshness of the fish. I have never been disappointed over the quality of the food. The rolls and such are pretty standard. They do have some ""showy"" pieces that look great on the plate but deconstruct the moment you try to eat it.  A few great tips, you can order what you want from the sushi masters if you don't see anything you want go by. Try the Inarizushi (pouch of fried tofu filled with rice, edamane beans and tuna), tuna, salmon, scallops sashimi... There are some interesting looking sushi as well, still not sure what the fish was but it was melt in your mouth good and had a little bit of mint tucked in for good measure. My second tip is to keep track of what you eat. It is SO easy to over-eat since the food continously passes by! Oh and if you order ice cream, it comes with two giant scoops - worth sharing!  One tip for the restaurant - work on the spicy mayo. Mayo + spiracha hot sauce = not OK. Be adventurous with the spice. The hot mayo ruined my beautiful spicy scallop roll. *sad face*",1,1
"Once I tried this rotating sushi bar, I cannot stop myself from coming often!   I feel like I was in a fish market to pick whatever sushi and sashimi that's fresh, and eat immediately!  The difference is its clean, comfortable and with great service! Not many restaurants provide a warm towel when you sit down, here I love this service before indulging in my sushi, my hands feel clean and ready to eat my sea food.   The quality of sushi and combinations are great.  It surprises me the first time.  It's like yuzu or japango quality but a better price and the best is they rotate in front of me!  I think it's the only rotating sushi in downtown, it's amusing to have dinner here. It brightens my nothing much going on weekend! Love this place! Will keep going back!",1,1
"The sushi here is absolutely FANTASTIC. I have had sushi at many places in Toronto but this by far is the best I have ever had.   We came here as a group of 4 for a belated father's day dinner. We were immediately seated at the sushi bar and drinks were served promptly. I really liked the way they had the little boats carrying plates of sushi round and round the bar. I particularly enjoyed the spicy salmon rolls. They were truly exceptional. We ordered some appetizers-Chicken Karaga and Shrimp Tempura both were good. For my main entree i ordered the japanese RibEye steak which was cooked to my liking. All in all, i give this place 5 stars because the sushi was absolutely divine. Seriously if you know any better places than this please let me know!",1,1
"Sushi is good as usual, but nothing outstanding. The rolls were good, the sashimi was large and fresh. and service was fine. The decoration inside was pretty.",1,1
"April 5/13 Three of us walked over from the ACC for lunch at about 12:45. We had phoned three times to make reservations, but no one answered the phone. :(  We managed to get seats at the 'Lazy River Sushi Bar' (my term, not theirs) after a 5 minute wait. What fun! Sushi bearing wooden ships sail past you and you just pluck off the plates that tickle your fancy!  You know what you're spending by the colour coded plates. We tried pickled cuttlefish (yummy!), creamy avocado & crab, salmon sashimi and others, while watching the chefs in front of us prepare the food. We also ordered chicken and beef skewers from the extensive menu. Our server was friendly and efficient and the chefs were happy to answer our questions. Good fun and good food!",1,1
"This was definitely the most fun I've had in a sushi restaurant in recent memory!  Fune Japanese Restaurant is currently the only Japanese restaurant in Toronto that offers ""conveyor belt"" sushi.  What's more, their conveyor belt sushi is even more unique than the regular ones on a track because these were boats of sushi floating on water around a sushi bar!  K made reservations for us at the sushi bar where the sushi boat conveyor belt would be.  There's only a limited number of seats at the sushi bar so if you want to experience the floating boats moving in front of you as you eat, make sure you book a spot or arrive early.  (There are many other tables and a lot of seating in the rest of the restaurant, but those are for regular tables and dining off of the dinner menu.)  How conveyor belt sushi works is that each different coloured/patterned plate corresponds to a different price.  Whichever plate you take off of the sushi boat that has the food item on it, you will pay that for the item.  Thus, it's a per plate cost system.   After finishing the item on the plate, you stack the plates next to you on the table so that when it comes time to paying the bill, the server will count the number of plates and how many of each kind you ate.  At Fune Japanese Restaurant, the plates ranged in price from $3 to $7.  We started with a complimentary appetizer that had seaweed, cucumber, and imitation crab meat in a pickled brine.  Highlights:  -The salmon sashimi was AMAZING!  The marbling on the raw salmon was so pretty and demonstrated how fresh and fat it was -- fat in a good way!  The thick cut of the salmon sashimi contributed to the perfect texture and taste of the fish and was so smooth and a little creamy too.  Best salmon sashimi!  -Salmon roll that was torched with imitation crab meat, cucumber, avocado, Japanese mayonnaise, and fish roe. This was the best (and only roll) we had all night.  We actually ordered two plates of these after finding out how delicious this was.  -The torched sea bream was also amazing!  We watched the sushi chef torch this one too and nabbed it right away.  The top layer of the fish was torched so that the skin was ""fried"" to a crisp while the underside of it was still raw.  The skin was so crispy and slightly salted.  It was just delicious!  -The tamago was really well done!  The piece of scrambled egg was huge when compared to the tiny piece of rice that it was attached too.",1,1
Most.Fun.Ever. We were directed here by a very nice doorman after not making the cutoff for dinner at Yuzu No Hana. This place is right down the street and below street level. We had no idea about the sushi moat until we walked in and SURPRISE! How cool of an idea. I couldn't help myself and started taking dishes from the moat while my dining partner ordered off the menu. I'm sure I spent more than I would've have by just taking things that looked yummy. But it was a great way to try new rolls and really made our night by stumbling upon something so unique!,1,1
Was at lunch and had the best beef udon! (Beef very thick and tender - feels like Kobe beef!) and noodle very bouncy!! Definitely something different and unique!,1,1
"Today I had the chance to visit Fune with another coworker and the first time I tried their conveyor belt sashimi. Usually I come in to eat their sashimi lunch (which by the way is delicious) but to be more cost efficient - I ordered their $10 sirloin steak. Very affordable and reasonable pricing.   Trying their conveyor belt sashimi I had the scallop, squid, and uni - it was absolutely stunning the freshness and the quality. This is also quite the experience with the conveyor belt and the atmosphere can be quite romantic.   Would recommend the food, the atmosphere, and the restaurant to dine in for friends or as a date!",1,1
"Pretty tasty sushi and fresh.  The boats are fun if you have a child with you as I did with my 10 year old.    With the boats you can't really get too many kid friendly options but they still have plenty of variety with sashimi, California and spicy salmon roll, tuna etc  Service was very quick and attentive and professional.",1,1
"Love the freshness of the sashimi! The conveyor belt Sushi place beats all other similar ones, with the plates of Sushi and Sashimi on little boats flowing round and round in water. Vibrant crowd at lunch time, the owner is very accommodative to find me a seat around the belt. Attentive servers and very clean restroom. I'll go back next time when I am in Toronto.",1,1
"Forget sushi on a conveyor belt... At Fune you can grab plates off wooden boats in water circling the chefs! The sushi bar offers a variety of sushi, sashimi and maki to please everyone's tastes, and of course you have the option of ordering anything else off the menu.   At the bar, plates are colour-coded, corresponding to different prices, which are then counted at the end to make up your bill. This allows you to control your spending, though it's still not the cheapest and can add up if you get carried away!  The fish is very fresh, so far the freshest I've tasted in the city. There is also a calming waterfall along the wall and the decor is nice. Dress-code isn't casual or super-dressy; somewhere in between.   I definitely recommend trying the boat sushi bar because it's super-fun for everyone!",1,1
"One of my favorite pizza places, good pizza ,great hoagie, good spaghetti and gyros and pepperoni knots!",1,1
We ordered the spinach calzone and it was out of this world. We hope to find a restaurant around us that makes them as good as they did.,1,1
We were driving through the area and stayed at a nearby hotel. Ordered pizza online and mistakenly ordered our pizza from a different location. When I came to pick up our order...I learned my mistake and the staff were very nice and accommodating and made us another pizza right away...didn't charge me anything extra. This tired traveler appreciated that courtesy. Pizza itself was yummy. Toppings are very generous. Tomato sauce might have been a little light for my taste but I bet they would go a little heavier had I asked. That said - not a slice leftover. I would order from them again. Seems like they offer coupons/ deals on fliers that aren't necessarily online so you might want to call and ask before you order.,1,1
This was the first time we order pizza at this store. The service was very good the guy who delivered the pizza was very polite and friendly. The pizza was delicious. We will definitely make this our new delivery pizza store,1,1
"Nearing the end of a 4 day work week, which has seemed to drag on twice as long, a couple of co-workers and I were in need of a Friday afternoon attitude adjustment.  A quick survey on Buzzfeed, claiming to tell you what you were in the mood for for lunch, led us to the local Red Robin.  Before I get to Red Robin, let me say whoever is writing the algorithms at Buzzfeed deserves a raise because they were spot on.  Now on to Red Robin.  Red Robin is the perfect example of the old addage ""Don't judge a book by it's cover.""  I had this place pegged all wrong. From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like family.  John, our waiter, was having a rough day with a malfunctioning credit card machine, but if you think that changed his care and attentiveness, think again.  When he came to take our orders, I went with the Madlove burger.  Talk about fun.  If a burger topped with bacon, avacado, and onion strings is something that gets your taste buds tingling I strongly recommend this, if not read through the menu and pick out something that makes your mouth water.  A co-worker summed up my first Red Robin experience perfectly ""this beats a freaking salad any day.""  On the door Red Robin proudly hangs a sign that reads ""You'll be Happy Here,"" what they forgot to mention is how sad you'll be to leave.  Until next Red Robin, I thank you.",1,1
Thank you Red Robin for your lovely display honoring our military this Memorial Day. It is always a good feeling to visit establishments that honor the sacrifices of our military. Food was delicious as always. Server Reginald was terrific.,1,1
"There are a few other burger spots in my area, but I like Red Robin best of all. The burger is just really good.  What more do you need to know.  I recommend the bbq one with bbq sauce and onion strings on it.  Ok I want one now.  Perfect for kids too with cool decor to look at and good selection of items on their menu.",1,1
"I've been to this Red Robin a few times but want to give a review of my most recent experience.    I went during my lunch hour on the friday before Mother's Day.    I wasn't really impressed with where I was seated.  It was a 2 seater table right in the main walkway and I constantly had other customers walking by looking at my table.  But that is the only bad thing I can think of about this visit.  My server was helpful in suggesting items on the menu.  I placed my order and it was out it record time.    The food was great and before I had to ask for a refill on my fries, my server asked me and they were there in minutes.  I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  It was constantly refilled.  The server was very attentive and even pointed out a survey with the check.  I've had good service and bad service at this restaurant but I will say this, the management is always willing to make things better.  At one visit I had a terrible experience, did the online survey and the management contacted me and appologized and sent a $25 gift card.  Keep it up Red Robin.",1,1
"Good food and great service! Love the wiskey river burger! They recently revamped the kids menu with tons of options. My youngest is super picky, she found something to order and actually ate it. We usually order from the regular menu for the older one, but he new kids menu has something for the bigger kids too.",1,1
"Our waitress was very nice, our children have peanut allergies and she was very informative regarding allergies. The food was really good and quick. The manager came around checking to make sure every thing was great! Good times!",1,1
"Love their burgers, but the veggie burger made me sick and I wish they had a black bean burger!  Good fries, but they need a better beer selection",1,1
"Wow!!! What a difference from the last time we ate here! Our server, Ryan, was terrific, super friendly and a lot of fun. His attitude was really contagious and we quickly realized that there was a HUGE difference from our last visit. Ryan kept our glasses full and our burgers were served promptly, hot, and as ordered. We had a great time tonight and will definitely be back!! Thanks Ryan for making our Friday night out so enjoyable!",1,1
I am regular @ this location. Food was good and fries were hot. The server was not the friendly but hostess was lovely. Definitely will go for lunch since it is convinent to my job. LOVE THE FREE BIRTHDAY SANDWICH  AND BOGO ON TUESDAY.,1,1
"(6/11/17) I got another free burger for my birthday. I never used it last year and after reviewing my reviews from previous visits, I've decided to chance it. Ryan is our server once again. Apparently there are now 46 different burgers on the menu. Some are actually $15! Ryan remembered that I loved the root beer float, so its being made. I also ordered a guacamole burger. I can only pray that its tasty. My only other comparison is the Jumbo Jack from Jack in the Box.  So the root beer float is tasty and delicious! That's a good sign. Will I be able to drink 4 of them tonight I wonder? They are bottomless after all. As it was I only got 2 of them down. I have to remember to bring an ice tea spoon the next time that I go. They only provide regular length spoons and they're too short to leave in the glass.   The guacamole burger was a disappointment because when I lifted the bun I couldn't see any sign of the guacamole. I had been hoping for a messy burger. I was also annoyed that they eliminated their burger wrappers. But I've been annoyed at that for awhile now. What saved the burger was Ryan. When I lifted the bun to show him that there wasn't any guacamole on the burger, he dashed off to the kitchen and returned with a bowl of fresh guacamole. I suspect that whatever was put on the burger in the kitchen came out of a bottle. The burger itself was good, though nothing special. The fresh guacamole was tasty. I ate all of it.   To sum up the burgers are still average, but Ryan is a gem. He made my birthday supper a celebration instead of an average meal. If you visit this location ask to be seated in his section. The four stars are for him and the root beer float.",1,1
"Great place to take your family. Kid-friendly, all-you-can-eat fries  and burgers are always amazing! Love their sweet potato fries with a Bonzai Burger. The Royal Burger is the best Burger ever! (Medium cooked)",1,1
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and decent food. Service was a little slow, but not enough to complain about. I asked for a well done burger and got a burnt burger instead, but with enough mustard anything goes down better. I could eat the fries every day for the rest of ever. Not dying to come back, but I wouldn't refuse to go back either.",1,1
"Ae have dined here a number of times, including busy Friday evenings.  We've always had good luck with short wait times and quick delivery of our meals.  The prices are reasonable, and the food is good.",1,1
I order the California grill chicken sandwich which came with guacamole bacon cheese on it along with fries and I ordered a side salad it was very delicious I will come back it was kind of expensive but I had the chocolate molding brownie with ice cream for dessert so the total checking to 17 dollars and 6 cents so I get 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like the price kind of expensive,1,1
"So we decided to give this place another shot (and after speaking with Katie who I assume is the owner or GM). We came here for lunch, brought the kiddos. This time the server we had, her name is Ariel. Ariel was nothing but smiles and treated us with just the best possible service possible. My kids we all smiles when she came and checked in on us. The food this time around was definitely a 180 from the last time. The fries were done, apps and main course time in between was perfect and the only thing that was a miss, was they forgot my tartar sauce with my fish (but i honestly think it was because i asked for a side of ranch for my fries, no biggie). Ariel brought the missing tartar over in a hurry. One thing i dont like about here but this could me being old school, the at table kiosk thing. I think its.a great idea for paying the bill, but i think it takes away from the interaction between the waitress and customer. Thats just my opinion on that. Overall, Ariel did an amazing job taking care of us, checking in and making sure our visit here was a good one. She definitely nailed it on the head. As for the food, definitely a better experience and we will definitely return.",1,1
"My daughter and I are a fan of this place. I usually get their Bacon Cheeseburger and she gets the Arctic Cod fish and chips meal. They come with unlmited fries, but you usually will not get to the second servings of fries.  We also love their strawberry lemonades. Its unlimited refills and they have sweet strawberries in their lemonades.  The food is good, service is good and overall its a great place to go every other 2-3 months.",1,1
Great for families with young kids (very loud which can be really nice when you have a 1 year and 3 year old). The burgers are very good too. Their shkes and ice cream sundaes are not very good. otherwise we love it.,1,1
While in NC had to try red robin and I'm glad I did! Went late at night so the place was empty. I see others post about slow service and I can agree but I don't have NY expectations when I travel. Once we ordered it came up fast.   I had the burger with an egg on top ( forgot the name) and I thought it was so good! My Boyfriend had a bacon cheeseburger. We both left full and satisfied. If you're looking for a cheap bite I would recommend heading this way.,1,1
"Love the new plating and the food has bumped up in presentation and flavor. Plus what kid or fry lover can resist bottomless fries? The healthy options are a plus,  definitely a worthy burger spot.",1,1
I have been to several Red Robin's locations in the area. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and chilled. The staff is always friendly as a matter of fact the witnesses we had today we had last time we were here and that was about a year ago. Today me and my family came just because we had a taste for it. The Manager was very very friendly and as always the service was good. However no matter when I have went the food is only average. The image Red Robin portrays you would expect better than average food. Also if you are like me and like chili cheese fries but don't like beans beware they have beans in there chili. On a good note when it's your birthday they give you a free ice cream sundae and burger! OMG it's is so...... GOOD! We was here about a week after my birthday but I had to the end of the month to use my free birthday burger so that's how I ended up with the sundae. It was so good I didn't want to share so I had to buy my kids a free one. Over all a good spot but would be so much better if they improved the quality of the food.,1,1
"Hamburger heaven!  Juiciest burgers ever and the best combination of toppings I've seen in a while.  I particularly like the black and blue burger I think it's called.  Comes with onion strings and blue cheese crumbles...to die for!  As with all Red Robin locations...endless fries....enough said.  I just wish the fries were of the shoe string type and not the steak style but no worries, still great.  My girlfriend and I stopped in at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed so that's always a good indicator that the food is really good.  The service was fine, seating took a little bit, but nothing to really complain about and the food took a little longer than expected to reach the table but again, they were busy!  Still one of my favorite hamburger spots...EVER :)",1,1
I just had an amazing burger at this establishment.  I ordered the Smoke & Pepper burger. It was incredible.  I think I paid about $13 for it and man was it money well spent.  My wife ordered some sort of chicken sandwich and she loved it.    The restaurant had a great layout and it was really clean.  The servers couldn't have been nicer.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll be back.,1,1
"Their food is always fresh and delicious. Of course I love the bottomless fries, and the freckled lemonade is my absolute favorite!!! The servers here are always pleasant and helpful",1,1
"If you want a good burger and some great steak fries, this is the place to go.  Be prepared to pay out a small fortune but it sure beats most of the competition. I generally have a good experience everytime I go and at every one I have been too.",1,1
"I am a fan of this place, definitely. The only thing is that the last time I went, the service was bad. My waitress forgot about little things I asked for, which I think she realized after a while. Then she apologized, after a different waitress took care of my requests.  The menu has lots of different options. Lots of burgers, sandwiches, and drinks. The burger buns can be substituted with a soy bun also.  It is often crowded, but the place is kept clean. I like Red Robin.",1,1
"Another solid visit at Red Robin!   This time I tried a burger...but not just any burger I tried the Burning Love burger...which has jalapeño coins, pepper jack cheese, salsa, chipotle mayo and lettuce on a jalapeño cornmeal kaiser roll. Whoa....sounds delicious....excuse the drool!   I made a few substitutions, chose a garden burger instead of the beef patty and left off the salsa...and it was as perfect as I expected!   The garden burger was delicious and the spicy kick I was looking for was definitely there!! You already know I LOVE the jalapeño coins...but the jalapeño bun and pepper jack cheese were a perfect pairing...totally burning love in my book!   And what's not to love about endless steak fries...I left stuffed and very happy!",1,1
"Very nice theater. They have made a lot of improvements. I saw Wonder Woman here. The sound and screen were incredible. They had very comfortable seats. The only thing that was a bummer was that mine and most of the friends that I came with, our seats would not recline. Lucky a few friend's seats reclined, but quite a few of us were stuck with our seats in the initial position.",1,1
"What???? What are these???? When I sat down on these new, leather recliner seats, I thought I was dreaming or in cinema nirvana.  Here's the deal folks...  these seats recline such that your feet are horizontal.  Did you hear me?  Horizontal.  Like being at home with the best recliner you have in the house.  The only downside is that if you come here super late or tired, YOU WILL definitely fall asleep.    I have to commend AMC for their total renovation and for installing this INSANELY delicious seating.  I still can't believe it.  INSANE.",1,1
"This is an awesome theater.  It has reclining leather seats and a bar.  I love that you can reserve your seats so you don't have to show up an hour before a movie just to get a good seat.  They have a rewards program where you get points for every dollar you spend, which is great.  We enjoy going to this location to see movies.  The one issue with this theater is that the ticket prices are pretty high, even the children's ticket prices are high.",1,1
"I really do love this place! From the super comfortable chairs to the snacks and cocktails it's actually better than Fat Cats but not quite as good as Studio Movie Grill. The upside is you can order cocktails and take them into the theatre to enjoy with the movie. The downside is the price! They equate to the price you'd find at a concert or sporting event. Either way... go in early to grab a cocktail, carry it to the seat with you, & kick up for feet for a couple hours of uninterrupted relaxation!",1,1
"Best movie theater in Gilbert in my opinion! Yes many others now have reclining seats, but these are by far the best! Very clean, giant bathrooms, and outrageously priced food (to be expected at a theater). If I'm not mistaken I also think this is one of the only theaters nearby that stills has matinee prices as well...",1,1
"This theater is awesome. They have very comfortable seats. I believe all the chairs are recliners and the sound quality of the theaters are fantastic. Could be a little cleaner between films, but it's not that bad.",1,1
"I am fascinated by a theatre that is willing to give up seating space for the sole reason of providing the ultimate in a comfortable viewing experience. I object to the ridiculous Gold Pass. In my time (about 3 months) of attending this theatre I have watched 3 families told to move out of the Gold Pass only lines. Why would a theatre open themselves up to negative reviews like this? When 15 people witness a family being treated badly it is a negative experience for everyone involved in the incident. But, I still give it 5 stars because I love being able you fall asleep in a comfortable chair when I'm stuck watching a movie I don't like.",1,1
"Enjoy coming here because they have the big comfy leather seats that recline. Theaters are always kept clean, food and service are always good.",1,1
"Love the comfy seats, love how you can pick your own seating. The only thing I do not like is if you go online to buy tickets they make you pay a convenience fee.",1,1
"First time at this particular AMC, and it was a nice experience! The bar area is super cute, and I like that they have recliners and how spacious it is. The bathrooms were clean, and over all I would definitely be back here.",1,1
"Love the reclining chairs! I did not even have to complain that I sat in the second row from the front because the chairs recline enough for me to sit comfortably and view comfortably! The theater is nicely built and has a pokestop in the front haha. The AC is nice as well, not too cold or hot during the movies. This is definitely my future go-to theater when I'm in the area :)",1,1
"My husband and I went here last weekend to see Civil War. It looks like the renovations are complete and it looks great. The seats fully recline, the soda fountain is one of those new coke ones that have a million choices, and  the bar in the corner is a nice touch. Yes, the snack bar is expensive. If you can get past that, it's a great theater experience.",1,1
"Great reclining seats! That night, however, it was Very dirty. They seemed to be understaffed, long lines, trash in our seats and cup holders.",1,1
"Love the reclining seats.  Nice remodel job.  Went to see Manchester by the sea on January 2, 2017. Great show BUT the screen had this dark Mark in it. At fist I thought it was a mile on the actor's face.  Then realized it was a dark Mark on the screen.  Hard to focus on the show. Clean theater and great environment otherwise",1,1
"Brooklyn Bowl. Now this place is awesome! I always say you can trust a place w/ PBR on tap and my rule has yet to let me down lol They get some of the best shows in town and their tickets are reasonably priced (I heard locals get 2 4 1 tix if bought at the box office but always forget to ask). Combining bowling, fried chicken and live music is an interesting concept but seems to work considering this isn't their 1st rodeo w/ locations in NY and somewhere else. After many visits we broke down and tried the fried chicken (how could you not?). It was quite tasty. Not the cheapest fried chicken prices but I get it. Worth it, especially if you're already there watching or waiting for your band.   The bowling is cool too. I heard there are like 30 lanes in there but don't know where they're hiding them all. A cool feature is if you get a lane while a concert is going on they broadcast a live feed on the big screens that sit above the end of each lane, looks cool. If you forget to wear shes w/ socks you can score a pair but they'll run ya like $6 (ouch!).  They have a decent draft selection w/ both PBR & Stella making the cut and being somewhat affordable, so kudos to that. PBR weighing in at $6 and all other beers I think are $7. Mixed wells drinks will run you $12. Their gried chicken (what they're known for) is pricey as fux but equally as good. 8 piece of dark will run ya $24, $26 for mixed & $28 for all white. They have the shoe string fries and for $4 they're worth it. I saw calamari on the menu and we were hella tempted but had already ordered all that other goodness and for $14.50 was too much for us to add to the tab. C'mon, we need room for drinks too.",1,1
"My cousin and I had no plans on a Thursday night when we arrived in Vegas. I remember seeing an event posted about a concert at the Brooklyn Bowl in the Las Vegas Yelp events. So, we ended up attending the concert. The concert line had the following artists: Anuhea, Rebel Soljhaz, and J-Boog. Apparently that evening the concert sold out!  This venue was a multi-floored building, with multiple bars, lounges, and a huge stage with a spacious standing/dancing area. I wanted to check out the multi-laned bowling allies, but the area was closed off due to the concert. I was disappointed that we didn't get to try the fried chicken here. We had dinner prior to attending the concert. We did get a couple cocktails. Drinks were very pricey. Two Jamesons and ginger ales came to a total of $32.  The venue overall was very impressive to me.",1,1
It's hard for any small venue to compare to the original Brooklyn Bowl but the Las Vegas location comes close. The chicken was just as good. The sound was excellent. The staff were helpful and super nice. They let me stash my leftovers behind the bar during the show...,1,1
"Awesome fried chicken, best burger I've had in years and the fried pickles are a can't-miss. Thank you for great dinner, fun bowling and an amazing show!",1,1
"We always have a blast at concerts here. Last night was a slight exception (one of us early executed). The staff were extremely patient,  helpful and professional in assisting with the situation.  Thanks Brooklyn Bowl!",1,1
"Brooklyn Bowl can in many ways be favorably compared to House of Blues, with the notable addition of a bowling alley. I have to disclose that I have never eaten or bowled here, but the venue is great for live acts. In the relatively short time they've been open, Brooklyn Bowl has been able to book some top up-and-coming acts as well as bands with legendary status.  The sight lines are pretty clear. The stage can be easily seen from anywhere in the room, whether you're near the bar enjoying a drink or you're right in front of the stage. The sound quality is excellent, and the staff has always been friendly.  Parking may be the only issue as this venue is in the heart of The Strip. You'll compete with tourists riding the High Roller and visiting the Linq for parking spaces. So figure that into your travel time. All in all I love coming down to Brooklyn Bowl for their outstanding slate of live shows. Well done!",1,1
"Great Venue on the smaller scale. Very intimate, not only can you bowl, eat, lounge and socialize you also get to check out your favorite music bands.. Great variety and great location...",1,1
"I have gone to the OG Brooklyn Bowl several times and when this opened up a few months ago, I knew my summer was going to be filled with awesome live music.  Saw Bonobo a few weeks and it was quite the amazing show. Everyone vibing! If Bonobo stops in your town this fall, you must go see him!  Heading out tonight to see Thievery Corporation and maybe get my fingers dirty with some fried chicken.  Have a great summer Yelpers!",1,1
"Jay in upstairs restaraunt is the bomb.....great guy.  Was here on three consecutive days to see Phil Lesh and Freinds.  Ate here 2X, their fried chicken is THE BEST anywhere...........for real!!! Great venue for concerts. nice employee's very helpful. the outside patio makes a nice touch and saves many steps in and out in order to get fresh air or for those who smoke.  Bowling is all state of the art, very modern, very clean.",1,1
"Went in for an early dinner during happy hour. Pretty quiet while we were there which was nice. It was still early, and I need several drinks before my old fart ears can handle music played at Vegas volumes. Shared some fries that were sort of like poutine, pretty good. Had high expectations for the chicken, and it didn't let me down. My side of red beans was also tasty. Half price drinks and app, I felt like we got out of there pretty cheap. Staff was on top of everything, gave us the right amount of attention. I really have no complaints or constructive criticism.   I'm not much of a bowler, but a lot of the bands that have played or are scheduled to play there are bands that I'd like to see. I'll be back for sure. Hopefully someone good will be playing next time I'm in Vegas, but if not, I'll still come in for drinks and/or dinner.",1,1
"This is a multipurpose space (dining, bowling, and musical entertainment), but having seen it featured years ago for it's fried chicken I was clearly there for the grub. Being a fried chicken connoisseur, I know how to tell what's sufficient, adequate, and optimal. This fried chicken battered in matzo and seasoned with some kind of magic dust is a first ballot hall of famer.  The crunch is one to remember. Matzo gives it a unique taste and texture you're likely not to have experienced. The seasoning is whimsical. Flavorful, but not overwhelming. Spiced, but not hot. However you decide to order just plan to for everyone to have at least two pieces. We ended up with 16 after initially ordering 8.  Here's what took this place to a five: Buttermilk pancakes. Yes, that good and I don't even like pancakes. First off, it can feed a small family of four or two hungry versions of myself. Yup, couldn't finish it. Maybe in my college years I could have done it. The pancake had crunch on the outside yet remained extremely fluffy in the inside. I've never had a perfect pancake and if I ever had to declare one to be flawless I'd put house money and my life savings on this recipe.  My suggestion is that share it so you can enjoy at least two pieces of chicken :)  This place is en route to the high roller so if you plan on going on that attraction I suggest you eat here after in case you get motion sickness.",1,1
"Love this place..great crowd and staffs, love the music specially when they played reggae...clean, good selectiona of food. Definitely a place not to miss when in town.",1,1
Went to the bar at 11:00 pm and happy hour was just getting started.  The fried chicken wings are incredible.  All beer was half off with great service.,1,1
"Very intimate concert scene at the Brooklyn Bowl.  Tickets run for about $40 which is very reasonable for Las Vegas and the venue allows you to have a great view wherever you are.  It's small enough to have a concert feel without the packed house and falling over each other.  I  In other words, the bar is expensive.  Beers run about $9 and mixed drinks $15.  After 11pm is half off all drinks so I would always wait for that surprisingly good deal if given the chance.  The headliners come on at 10pm usually, so if you can hold off, sneak to the main bar, and grab a bunch of drinks, then you might just go ahead and beat Vegas for once.  You can hear the act throughout Bowl so once you get up you can sit outside, at the main bar, or in the venue and listen.  I recommend coming early to at least hear the opener (if not see), and just hang on the Bowl balcony and people watch.  Nice concert venue, cool Linq area, cheap prices for tickets - I'll definitely catch another show in the future.",1,1
"Talk about Why! WHY! It took me this long to come back for some of Brooklyn Bowl famous fried chicken. I just want to beat myself up. Literally puts the saying winner winner chicken dinner! In complete context. It by far the best fried chicken had in long time and the best part is not commercialize/fast food fried chicken. I had the complete chicken dinner so it came with mash potatoes and collard greens. The mash potatoes was super creamy silky consistency and the gravy was solid brown gravy. The two combine made for the perfect balance. Collard greens must admit had my reservations about cause collard greens had more bad then good experiences. I was impressed. Not only was the collard greens cooked on point but the nice size diced pieces of fried bacon. It had perfect aroma of greasy cooked bacon and sautéed collard greens! I could have had bowl of collard greens be happy in life. The star of the show the fried chicken. I have no idea the breading mixture they use. I would love to know cause dam I would make fried chicken more often even though my heart would regret it. =(( It not only the common traits the crispy skin, moist meat, and cooked through perfect. Something about the skin not only crispy but more depth to it. The fried skin on this one has the crunch. But it not overly greasy and kind of flaky when bite into it rather then one bite the whole fried skin comes off in one shot. The hot sauce they make in house makes it even more tasty. Not that it needs the extra flavor. Hot sauce and fried chicken need I say more...Not! Our server recommended doing combination of hot sauce and honey. I tried on the side but for me combination overly sweet for my taste buds. I would highly recommend trying both. I just prefer the hot sauce. There lot of different options that can choose from dark meat to white meat. So no worries if only want one kind of meat. The wedge salad looked amazing. My cousins meet for dinner they shared order. They told me was great. I never tried it but eye appeal looks as good as they told me it tasted.  The bartenders were awesome! I was meeting cousins that was visiting from out of town. We started at the bar drinking some of the great options of craft beers on tap plus Brooklyn Bowl finest!! Just ended up having dinner at the bar. We were there for so long had two different bartenders. Both were on top of it. I love energy both gave out. They were super friendly answering any questions we had and when brought out the condiments reminded us try the hot sauce and honey on the chicken. My cousins and Me both ordered the fried chicken dinner.   The only thing that was sad is fact was walking into ghost town. I know during concerts they do well cause I know been here for concert. Nothing going on that night. For second going upstairs thinking myself is this place even open and no life in the place. My cousins got there first and they thought the same thing. Hopefully Brooklyn Bowl sticks cause they have the best fried chicken in my mind hands down!!!! Just wish closer and not on the strip. I will be back.",1,1
"Best fried chicken...Mac n cheese was incredible! Fries were shoestring style...nice n crispy..my friends had pulled pork sliders and a grilled veggie sandwich...we ate on the patio with a nice view and atmosphere.  Our server was slow, never checked on us or filled our waters.  The bus boys did a great job picking up his slack. Bringing us fries and condiments. .A really good spot to eat after riding the high roller. A great venue to hear music too! Our groupon 20% off came in handy and we took half our large portions back to our room as a midnight snack...The sides for the chicken dinner were average...greens were a little bitter and mashed potatoes with gravy a bit heavy and underseasoned.",1,1
I attended the Offspring show in July. What a BLAST! The security was very serious about their j.o.b. which was nice for a change. I'm used to seeing hot girls getting free passes into VIP & blatant ignorance of wasted guests if they know anyone in the establishment. But not the case here which made my viewing pleasure even better! I didn't bowl or try the food because bowling alley food can't be too great. Boy was I sorry after seeing the fried chicken & apps menu. But next time I'll try the food. Drink costs were on par for the strip. They did have Sailor Jerry which was a bonus. Also a bonus were the bar staff. They remember your face/drink & even gave up free soda for the DD. This place gets my vote for AWESOME!,1,1
"Very cool venue that tries to replicate the warehouses of Brooklyn.  Love the attention to detail of the space (brick, concrete, pipes).  Saw Brown Sabbath here on a Friday night and there was no cover.  Drinks are a bit pricey but hey I didn't pay to get in so who's complaining.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but would be a cool place to get dinner before a show.  There are a few bowling lanes to the left of the stage and the whole place has a great ambiance.  Would definitely hit it up again if there was a good show happening or for a round of bowling.",1,1
"Not the best music venue in town, IMO, but I do appreciate their aggressive booking. From A-listers to locals, this place books them. The food isn't bad either, but a little pricey. If a band you like is playing, definitely buy tickets.",1,1
"The corn... Good God the corn. Queso cheese and spices... We fought over two helpings!!! The staff was friendly and super helpful when my blackened catfish was too salty for my taste and let me switch to the fried chicken which I'd definitely recommend. I didn't have to ask for refills of the lemonade, they appeared automatically! Such an amazing time and so delicious!!!",1,1
"Love this place and what an awesome venue. Very cool for us locals or tourists. Saw Erykah Badu there last night. Amazeballs as always.   The food, accommodations and staff were great I splurged and had some of the fried chicken. So worth the extra time at the gym, that I didn't do yet.   Could use a little help at the front door and VIP line but still an awesome experience. Can't wait to go again!",1,1
Great venue for live music. Best seat in the house anywhere you are. Great for late food and bowling of course.,1,1
"Rating this not as a restaurant, but a concert venue.  Came here to see Jane's Addiction.  What a great venue for a concert!  No seating, standing room only, but small enough that you can see the stage from anywhere, and large enough not to be overly crowded.  Had a great time.  Multiple bars to get drinks at, and even with a concert going on, wasn't hard to get a drink (no line).  Looks like a fun place to hang out even without a concert.  Multiple bars, glow in the dark bowling, and I'm assuming when there's no concerts that they must have dancing...they have the room for it.",1,1
Great staff love the music hard to bowl with the graphic screen or they would have gotten 5 's love the fries! Haven't been here for a concert yet. I'll let you know how that goes once I cross that bridge,1,1
"What a FUN PLACE!!!  This was my second time here.  Just had drinks last night.  The time before we had dinner and it was great.  The Rock and Roll Fries were fantastic, as was the Veggie Buster.  But the best part is the atmosphere.  Just a lot of fun good music great vibes and everybody had a blast.  And we didn't even bowl.  That's for next time.",1,1
"I was surprised by this place I have to say. The place is huge. It has a bowling alley which is cool and a stage for live music. It could get a bit loud at times. We ordered the knish which was outstanding wish it was bigger because it was so good. Then had the fried chicken which was awesome as well, also had the blackened salmon which was a little disappointing wish was seasoned a little better I couldn't taste the pepper other than that place is really cool and the service was on point!  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes",1,1
My husband and I visited this venue last weekend for stick figure- it was a nice little venue! Great location pretty spacious with a lounging area. Also a small bowling alley is located in the venue! Fun spot!,1,1
"Saw OK GO here like 2 years ago, awesome show, great venue, spectacular chicken.  If you don't want to spend $18 - 22 for their platters just get a 6 or 8 piece of the wings for like $10-12. The ""wings"" are HUGE and are almost as big as the regular chicken! Its still super delicious and I promise you will still have the same chicken experience as if you got the platter. How do I know?  I've had them both son!!!",1,1
This place is awesome!!  So much fun for both adults and kids. The atmosphere is incredible there's so much to do and see plus the food is great!,1,1
"I had been here twice for my father in laws show presentations and both times I had enjoyed very much. The staff is on top of everything , they make sure you have  what you need .   I love the fact that th band can be playing music and you can also  .  They do have upstairs a balcony and you can sit and also listen to the bands playing from the speakers  then add that you have a beautiful view of the linq .  I haven't tried the food area but next time I will .",1,1
"Love coming to Brooklyn Bowl, great venue for concerts and great food.  The concert venue itself is a little smaller and more intimate which is nice because you feel like you're still in the action whether your grabbing a beer, you're in the middle of the floor or you're in the last row against the wall near the Lighting technician.  The bar can get a little crowded but there's 3 bars in the area you can order from in the concert section of the venue.  We usually eat at the restaurant either before or after the concert and will always order the fried chicken, don't miss this!! I always say I'm going to try some of the other items on the menu especially the desserts but after a few beers and pieces of fried chicken I'm usually done for the night.  Wait times for food can be little long from what I've noticed so just prepare for that.  If you're planning on a concert and dinner expect to spend about $30/each for show tickets, $15 fried chicken and $8 for beer.  About a $100-$150 night, but definitely worth it for what you get!",1,1
"Brooklyn Bowl is by far the most amazing indoor music venue I've ever been to and without a doubt the coolest new spot in Las Vegas.  Finally, a 21+ venue that books great talent and does not focus on electronic music, DJs, or the Vegas club scene!  We grabbed tickets to see Local Natives on Sunday night.  First of all, the venue is absolutely gigantic. From the outside, I would never have expected it to be this big. There's a restaurant area (I'll be back to check out the food) and about 5 different bars that make a nice exterior border of the space. There are TWO floors everyone has access to - each floor with bars along side the stage.  On tap options include Rogue Dead Guy Ale and three different ""Brooklyn Brews"" beers. The bar staff was also really friendly and helpful - after ordering a Dead Guy Ale and a coke, the bar tender asked if the coke was for my DD and when I said yes, she said no charge. Little things like that really made me feel happy about where I'm spending my time and money.   I don't think there's a bad view of the stage from any spot in the entire venue. The ""floor"" area in front of the stage looks big at first glimpse, but as soon as the band takes the stage and begins to play, the area immediately begins to feel more intimate, which makes for a great live music atmosphere. The venue also has pretty solid audio-visual. They're not trying to do too much by hanging huge screens everywhere or over the top lights and LED/laser shows.  Instead, the focus is on the band and the music, highlighted with an impressive mix of smoke effects and color schemes. No distractions - let the music and venue speak for itself.  The sound was absolutely incredible too - from every angle. I stood on the floor, on the side of the stage at the bar, in the back, upstairs, and in a booth at the bowling alley and the sound was consistently great. I'm not sure if this was because Local Natives was playing (they are SUCH a great live band), but I was super impressed by Brooklyn Bowl's acoustics.    Oh yeah, there is a bowling alley inside with lanes on both floors!!! At the back of every lane, there is a giant leather booth that overlooks the stage so you don't miss anything while you're bowling ... or, so you can just hang out and enjoy the show. Reserving a lane is probably the way to go when you've got a big group of friends - drink/food service, seating, bowling, and huge screens above every lane that show a live feed of the band that's playing. Can this place get any cooler??    I found my new favorite hangout and with the lineup they've created for the next few months, Brooklyn Bowl has something for everyone. Check this place out - you won't be disappointed.",1,1
"Props for the overall venue, but I grew up bowling old school style. This is a concert venue/bowling alley hybrid & I'm not sure what to make of it! Disclaimer- I won free bowling, concerts & comped food & drink from vegas seven. I was treated well and given a great bowling lane. We enjoyed the BLT (really good), french fries, and a few drinks. Prices are high for drinks, beer is $7-8, speciality drinks are $12. This may be on par with drink prices at other venues at the Linq, I'm just used to locals prices off the Strip During concerts, the screens on the lanes project the show. Looking forward to returning for another night of bowling!",1,1
Loved this place! The vibe was cool and casual and not the typical strip glam. We were a group of 11 and I just loved the set up for a group.  They piped in the music from the concert which was cool because I never really listen to that style but I super enjoyed it!  I will have to invite my friends next time we are in this area to relax and chill.,1,1
"Love coming to see concerts here. Feel this place embodies music better than the hard rock does now. I love where it located is well. But nothing better than getting a bowling lane, ordering food and drinks, and watching a show.",1,1
"If Nike chooses this place as their party venue, you know it's cool. Food was good, but parking was a challenge. Do not attempt the self park and valet at the Linq. Let's not forget headline concerts galore here!",1,1
"Ate there last night for my husbands bday. We had tried to get a reservation but was told there was no seating for our party of 14 and our best bet was to come early and try to find room in the bar. Walked in and spoke to the hostess, she said give me 2 minutes and let me check with the manager. In 2 minutes he walked us into the bar and with no less than 4 staff members helping, rearranged the entire space to accommodate our party saying ""I will find a way to feed you no worries"". What wonderful and unexpected service! Add to that, even though the place filled up, our waitress Kristen was quick, friendly and on top of our large group and it's needs. Add to that, the food, especially the fried chicken, was amazing!! They turned our frown upside down and took such great care of us- Great job Team Brooklyn Bowl!!!",1,1
"From 11/15/15  We came to here to see Motionless in White and The Devil Wears Prada. The Brooklyn Bowl is located in The Linq Promenade, and very easy to find- you can't miss it!  The box office to buy your tickets is on the outside of the venue and right next to the front doors. Once your inside of BB it's has a very cool vibe, with its decor, the 3 bars located in various sections for your convenience. The huge stage is in the center of all of this, with a wide enough area to view the concert you're attending. Drink prices are okay; A mixed drink is about $11!   Overall I like this venue; I need to come back for some food and actual bowling.",1,1
"What a surprise for the strip The food is good & fresh, the staff actually wants you there and is pleasant  Prices are on point, if we have guests come to town this is our new go to quick spot for good food & great service",1,1
"Music venue is really cool. Great sound, good sight lines, decent bar. It's ungodly overpriced. $9 for a beer is absolutely insane. I'd keep coming back though as long as they keep getting good acts. Sneaking in flasks is easy so just go that route.",1,1
"This was a one of a kind concert venue - bowling and listening to reggae music was amazing! Out of all the places, in Sin City!!! My friends and I wanted the full experience so when Common Kings were performing we just had to go!! The bowling lane was around $350 plus tax and $250 could be used for food and drinks...including alcohol. It's a max of 8 people per lane and the fee also includes bowling shoes. Great deal!   The bowling lanes were slightly elevated, about stage level which gave a perfect view of the concert. It was better than being in a crowded space during a concert. Our hostess was very attentive and I greatly appreciated it when she told me how much food/drink credit was remaining so that we wouldn't go over the $250.   No complaints and will definitely return when in Vegas again.",1,1
"Came for the Roots concert, stayed for the masterfully prepared food. The first time I went I had the pulled pork sliders and snacked off on some of my girl's calamari. The sliders were great and the calamari was awesome, not fried too hard. Perfect really. The next day we had their Blue Ribbon wings and they reminded us of home. Great experience all around, definitely go if you're in Vegas.",1,1
"Went to a concert here and we rented a bowling lane, it cost 590$ but you get a 450$ food and drink credit. 8 people can use the lane. we were standing looking right at the band like stage level. Never have experienced that before but I will go to more shows like that. Great food and service and at end of night we still had to order more food and drinks to fill our 450 credit.",1,1
"Just saw the Tedeschi Trucks Band at the Brooklyn Bowl. Wow!! What an unbelievable place to see a concert. We went early to grab some food before the show. Very cool sorta comfort food/bar food. I was boring and ordered a burger and my brother ordered the BBQ pork Sliders. Service was fast and friendly and the food was excellent. If you are a local you have to check this place out. I know that most locals want to avoid the strip most of the time but this is worth your time. All of the bowling lanes are situated right next to the stage and the floor where the concerts are so you can be bowling and enjoy a concert(we didn't bowl this time but we will next time).  The venue is small, probably would hold 2500 max and the floor is set up with no seating so you can wander right up to the stage if you want. It is hard to explain how cool this place is, I really hope it makes it here. Ticket prices are totally reasonable, I ordered my tickets online and paid $35 each( I saw them last year at the Hard Rock for three times that price and not that great of seats).  I will go back every chance I get.",1,1
"Tough review because it's such a great venue-and it also has let me down in more ways than one. I've been here twice now, once for Primus last year, and once for Tribal Seeds this last weekend. Primus concert was packed which makes it a little difficult to get bar service but it was still decent, the problem is the cost for the booze. Our first round for 4 shots of fireball the bartender only charged us $14. The second round we had a different bartender and it was $14/each. We basically bought the place 4 bottles for those 4 shots so buyer beware. PBR's are the way to go for only $6. I went last weekend for the Tribal Seeds show and with no warning, email, or anything the show had been cancelled due to a sudden illness. The other two bands were still there and they played a free show - so we will get a refund - but it was still a disappointment. I look forward to coming to town for another show sometime in the future.  Tips: There is a nice spot on the upper floor to sit down on couches and relax, and a great deck out the back (on both levels I think) for you to smoke if that's your thing!",1,1
atmosphere is slightly cramped but cool. Drinks are great and tasty. Food :. I find some things I am in love with like cannot get enough and others are good but not great. I like spicy but this place is extremely hot which I like. The only thing I would say is the portions are kind of small. I am a vegetarian and I find I need to order a main and a couple of tacos to feel satisfied. Maybe the meat dishes have more weight to them. They are really accommodating here. Both times I have been we showed up last min and they found us a table.,1,1
"I have been here a few times, but never got around to writing reviews for it.  The tacos aren't authentic, but they're tasty, amazing here, and full of good stuff.  You need to RSVP more than 1 week in advance for any of their locations though.  Be prepared to get your hands dirty.  :)",1,1
"We checked out Playa Cabana Cantina on a frigidly cold night back in February.  I would say that reservations are absolutely necessary if you want a table at this busy new Junction eatery.  They are easily made online at least 2-3 days in advance.  We were seated at a high top for 4 and our waiter, resembling a young Eric Stoltz, encouraged us to get drinks and an order of chips/guacamole ($8) to start.  There was no debate when we decided to get a pitcher of the Cantina Crossroads margaritas ($29) to share.  Our food order - a chicken burrito entree ($14), fish tacos ($13) and short rib brisket tacos ($14).  Added a side of beans and rice to the tacos ($3 extra).    The brisket tacos were delish and full of beef-y goodness but the fish tacos were a little on the bland side for flavor.  Chicken burrito was a hearty size.  Margaritas were tart, refreshing and took our minds off the -25 degree weather outside.  Could have definitely used a few more chips in the basket with the guacamole order...we ran out and still had guac left which I shamelessly dipped my tacos into.  A good meal and a fun atmosphere that took us South of the border and back without anyone getting Montezuma's Revenge.  Arriba, arriba!",1,1
"Came here with a large group of friends. Food was very good especially the chicken and lobster tacos. They are definitely must haves here.   The mojitos were good but like others have said, lacking in the alcohol content. There is also a decent list of wines.   The seating area and the chairs were quite uncomfortable and that's where I deducted the one star but the food was very good. They also take reservations which is quite important especially to a group as large as ours.",1,1
"When I usually feel like eating Mexican, always end up at Taco Bell or at my ex wife's - so Playa Cabana Cantina is an upgrade for me.   The place is cool and the food is pretty great. Nice location to have a few drinks and eat some good food. One of my Tinder premium 1st date location.",1,1
"Nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful service. The tacos are great, a little too messy but still very tasty. I tried 3 braised beef and they were huge and very filling.  The price is good for the amount of food you get.",1,1
"I've been twice now to this neat little Mexican joint tucked in the junction, a place where margaritas flow and the food comes out fresh and fast. We started with guac, which is actually mandatory at Mexican places, I'm not sure if you know that or not. On my first visit I tried a couple little tacos and on my most recent visit I upped the ante and went for the original plated burrito, a massive beast of a chipotle chicken burrito that came drizzled in delicious sauces and salsas and topped with more of that handsome guacamole. It was an impossible meal to finish, but I enjoyed every bite of what i did have. I love the decor in this establishment, it's fun and full of signs celebrating toronto, the junction and that Mexican influence. Service was great and they were able to easily separate bills for our large party. Can't wait to go back!",1,1
"The service is always friendly, the food is delicious and the drinks are unique. Although it's pretty pricey I think it's worth it, the quality is great. I've ordered several dishes in the past and the only one I was disappointed with was the lobster ceviche (a special that day), it didn't have enough lobster in it. I have had a bass one there and it was much better. The lobster tacos were unbelievable though. Overall a great place to go in the junction if you're looking for something interesting.",1,1
"As a self-proclaimed beer snob, we were in Toronto to check out the beer scene. Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.  The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.  My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.  If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.",1,1
"Went here again, without a reservation and we were able to sit at the bar. Since I didn't love my taco selection last time, I asked the bartender what she would recommend. I ordered the braised short rib crispy tacos based on her suggestion and they were ridiculously flavourful and delicious.  My friend had the fish tacos, and i swapped one of hers for mine and i found them to be  still just alright.  Much smaller and less hearty than the short rib.  Pretty slow service, but they definitely don't rush you out.",1,1
"Have been here a couple of times and the food is always incredible. Recently brought some friends in that were visiting Toronto and they loved it!  Make sure you start with the chips and guacamole/salsa, you will not regret it. They'll refill your chips at no additional cost, even after your dips are gone!  If you're really hungry, grab the Huevos Rancheros with pork fat fried beans. It's easily the best thing on the menu. If you're not willing to look like a pig in front of the rest of your dinner party, grab 2-3 tacos and that'll fill you up nicely after you scarf down the chips and dip.  I've had beer there, but on my most recent trip a friend wanted to get a drink/cocktail so I grabbed one too. The Patrick Swayze is terrible, has no presentation and should probably be switched out for a crazy margarita or something. Extremely disappointing for a $12 drink, but you live and you learn.  Service was incredible, but the music is a bit loud so you can hardly hear your server explain the menu unless you're seated right beside them. My friend who is a sound engineer took out his sound level meter and it was bouncing between 85 and 95 dB. He mentioned that anything over 80 for more than 2 hours can result in permanent damage, so I feel pretty bad for the staff.  4/5 because of that terrible drink and the loud music, but the food and staff are incredible and I'd highly recommend this place to friends.",1,1
"It was the worst car wash I've ever had done.  First I ask for the platinum $22 car wash and he tells me it needs to be hand washed because of the mud but he's do it for $25.  When I get up to the counter he added $5 for the hand wash making it $30.  What a schister!  And the wash itself was deplorable.  I admit it was a lot of work but I tip well.  They just missed so many areas it doesn't look like she even tried. Find somewhere else, you will be disappointed and taken.",-1,-1
"Frustrating experience here.  The guy sold me hard on a detail service, so I took it.  He said it would take 40-45minutes.  After an hour and a half, I insisted on leaving because I was already very late to take my child to an appointment.  I plan on calling to ask for a refund since they didn't finish the detailing.  Beware, they sell you hard and over-promise.  They are paid on commission obviously...",-1,-1
I arrived 8 mins before they closed and was given attitude and was refused a car wash.....said WE ARE CLOSED.  I drove 10 mins to go to this car wash.  Now I will never come back here due to poor customer service.,-1,-1
"I am disappointed in the car wash. I asked for the basic silver package. The person checking me in, mentioned my car could use a good wax, especially with summer coming. I caved and said yes and to condition the interior. Then the person asked me to upgrade again for 6 car washes. Really glad I said no to that. The packages are suppose to come with a scent. I asked the person what scents were available and he said I needed to get my own inside. Really! Take air freshener off the packages if you actually don't provide it and need to get your own. My car was suppose to take 30 mins. It took an hr. When I got my car back, the outside had many spots I was scratching off with my finger nails before I even got in the car. How can I trust my car was waxed when a basic fingernail removed obvious spots. Once in my car, and driving away, I noticed my dash board, center consul was not even wiped down and nothing was vacuumed. I went there for a basic clean and $55 later I didn't even get that. I will not be returning to this place. Very disappointed.",-1,-1
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!! DISHONEST BUSINESS AND STAFF!!!    The employee Adalila stated my car needed a $120 clay bar service to remove tree sap from my car and the car would be ready in 40min. Upon my car going through the 3 min car wash all the sap was removed! No longer needing the clay bar I asked for my money back but stating I would pay and tip for the car wash. She showed me paint overspray and said the clay bar would still help. 1hr later I came back to pick up my car  and all the paint was there, now Adalila tried to change the story saying it was a chip but when the other employee came to see what the issue was he was able to remove the paint over spray proving the clay bar work was not preformed. Adalila said the car wash was closing for the day and I could return the following day for a refund or the work to actually be done.   Tuesday I returned for the refund, Adalila was nowhere to be found. Raul the manager that day looked at my car and agreed the clay bar was not preformed and would take 2-3hrs. He stated he could do the work but Roberto was his manager and could issue the refund the following day.   I returned again the following day for my refund and was meet by Roberto stating he could not issue a refund, but agreed the clay bar work wasn't done. Roberto began to say only the owner could issue the refund and he refused to let me speak with the 'mystery' owner and the the owner could not be contacted in regards to issuing a refund for a service not preformed. After arguing with Roberto for 45 min, he now refused any refund would be possible.  Livid after spending 3 days dealing with a promised refund and getting the run around by multiple 'management' level employees I left.  Outraged by the service and basically being robbed blind of my money I contacted the BBB. In addition I will be filling a civil case.",-1,-1
"Where to start? First of all they have no express washes, you have to get out and walk nearly a block to the convenience store. The guy tried to start my already running truck before driving it to the next guy at the entrance of the tunnel wash. Where it sat for about ten minutes because they couldn't figure out how to restart the engine with an immobilizer sensor key. (That's my fault for not showing them how to start it, or giving them the valet key) but they never came to find me to ask. Then once they did get it into the tunnel wash they left my rear two windows down about an inch! Which flooded the interior door panels and seats. Livid, I get the manager who just said they would vacuum it up. They ended up wiping down the interior and cleaning my tires. I expected them to shampoo the seats because of their stupidity but I'm just glad I got out of there alive with no scratches or damage to my truck. The wash and work was subpar. A $3 car wash joint cleans better. Their waiting room had a dead cockroach and the car wash machines looked very worn out. Never again! Almost as lame Jacksons up the road is better.",-1,-1
"I hate to be critical, but I can't help it in this case. This is a broken down facility, understaffed and very slow. The car wash was so bad that when the car came out it needed to be washed.",-1,-1
This is a ridiculously bad facility. Their equipment doesn't work. Even most of the water hoses inside the actual car wash are not producing water. The store inside has shelves that are one third full and it looks like a scene from The Walking Dead. There are Board of Health signs on the soda machines that they're no longer allowed to serve food. This appears to be a place that is trying to wash a few more cars from the grave. I did the Groupon deal to get to know this place. I now know it well enough to not be back.,-1,-1
"I bought a groupon for 3 silver car washes. I have never had worse service! Before they even find out what you want, they start a 5 minute spiel to sell you more! They staff very low so it takes forever! Everyone moves at a snails pace and show no motivation to provide customer service. I will never go back! Cobblestone is by far the best car wash for efficient, good service!",-1,-1
"Rude, rude, rude employees. I saw a lane open and the cashier was standing at the beginning of the isle, when I pushed my cart that way she turned her back to me blocking me from entering. I said excuse me is this lane open. She turned and looked at me like I was interfering with her day dream. Then said yes. She went behind the register and I started to unload stuff. She asked if I had coupons, I said yes and continued to unload. When I saw she wasn't ringing anything up, just standing there I stopped and faced her she said I have to have the coupon before I can start. I have never heard of that before but gave her the coupon. She then started to ring up things, very slow looking over everything like she was shopping. I just waited patiently. She never once smiled or offered a hello, have a nice day, nothing. Even when I said hello she said nothing, at the end I said have a nice day but still nothing from her but blank stare. I will never go back to this Walmart.",-1,-1
Peggy our cashier was unhelpful disrespectful & unpleasant. This Wal-Mart needs to figure out if they price match or not!  There is no reason to be unpleasant because we wanted to use their price match program on a few bananas. Please train Peggy or have her stock shelves or something.,-1,-1
"This review is for the tire and lube department. Brought my daughter's car for an oil change in December of last year. They broke the plug and didn't say a word. She took her car to a different Walmart store to get it done again and they refused to change the oil because the plug is broken, said she needs to get it fixed and call the store that broke it and talk to a manager about getting reimbursed for the repair. We have called numerous times, been oh hold for over an hour, explained the situation to multiple associates but still didn't get to talk with a member of management.",-1,-1
"Wow is this place ghettooooo.  I dislike Wal Mart to begin with but, man this place is bad. I went in there because someone gave me a give card to Wal Mart, and was going to use it on a gift for my father. They didn't have what I was looking for, which is really not that big of a deal. They helped me with finding it at the San Tan location (which is much nicer).  But then ghetto happened, as I was walking out the door, three employees were standing there talking about a customer and dropping F bombs like it was nothing. Now I cuss like a sailor, but not in front of a customer for heavens sake.",-1,-1
I had a horrible experience with two extremely homophobic employees making fun of my son because he was dressed as a cat for Halloween. They made comments saying it was 'gay' and 'just wrong' for me to have bought him such a feminine costume. Absolutely repulsed by my service here and will never be back. Do not give them your business.,-1,-1
"Always shop here and abhor my trips more and more. People that shop here are bottom of the barrell hill billy trailer trash (on second thought, what does that say about me hmmm I hope not much?!)  Truthfully, only come here for the cheap prices on laundry soap, beauty products and Frisky cat food cans. Their food selection is that of a barrio's tienda - think Food City.   Also refuse to get rung up by cashiers, Wal-Mart really does stay true to their EOE hiring procedures. Cashiers are either 80 years old and suffering from paralysis or 20 years old with learning disabilities.... Now there's nothing wrong with that, but I can navigate through self check out in a fraction of the time.",-1,-1
"I just have to warn everyone about the oil change department. I was there for almost four hours today with two small children. I was spoken to very rudely from the start. I blew it off because I felt bad that the technicians were outside on a hot AZ day. However, it kept getting delayed because they kept messing up. Long story short my perfectly functioning car was smoking and making loud noises at the end. No one would help me or take responsibility for it. I've got a incident report and heading to my mechanic to fix whatever they did to my car. Hopefully Walmart takes responsibility for it. I shouldn't have done a oil change at Walmart in the first place. Don't make the same mistake!",-1,-1
"Review about their Pharmacy: went through drive through at 8pm as my kids have pneumonia, the lady was rude from the beginning and after waiting for about 20 mins bc they didn't have the prescription ready, 3 hours after my kids doctor appointment, the pharmacist told me to come inside so he can explain to me what I can read on the bottles, I explained my situation- that all 3 of my kids are sick, it's late, and it'd make my life a lot easier if I didn't have to get them all out of their car seats when he could just explain through the intercom/video feed. They came back on and lied to me, saying they couldn't fit the bottles in the tube, I go inside to find that the antibiotics were in small bottles, and could in fact fit in the tube. Pharmacist mumbled the directions to me and wouldn't even look me in the eye, I picked it up and just went home and read the instructions. I am frustrated bc there is a reason they have a drive through pharmacy, convenience. The pharmacist is absolutely rude, I'll be sure to go to CVS pharmacy if I ever have a prescription to pick up.",-1,-1
I've been coming to this pharmacy for a long time now and never had such an issue as I have today. Waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes because there was people ahead of me inside. Finally was told medicine would be ready in 30 minutes so 37 minutes later I went back and was told won't be ready for another 20 minutes. Of all times when husband just got out of surgery and needs to keep up on the scheduled meds he is now behind because they can't staff the appropriate amount of people. Time to find a more reliable pharmacy.,-1,-1
What is going on at Walmart stores? We shop at both Greenfield and Southern stores. The shelves are always empty. I don't mean all the shelves but a lot of the are empty. When you ask management they blame THE WAREHOUSE. I like Sam' s Club water (24 bottle) they now have Nestles water instead. Is Nestles paying them more to promote their brand? Management needs a shakeup. I threw 9 empty boxes from the frozen veg section on the floor to find what was behind them. Very poor attention to stocking.,-1,-1
"Ok, my 2 star review is based solely on the food, specifically the pancakes.  As has been mentioned, they are ginormous.  They are very thick, and neither fluffy nor light.  I got whole grain pancakes and maybe that had something to do with it, but my kid's pancake was not that great either.  That said, if I was rating on other criteria:  Service - 4.5 stars.  Another review mentioned a problem w/ coffee refills.  Mine was refilled constantly, after 2-3 sips!  Maybe because we were next to the coffee station?  Service would be 5 stars in my kids' eyes since after they cleared off (ate!) the whipped cream from their pancakes the waitress came around and asked ""need more whipped cream?""  Price - 5 stars (neglecting that the food was not great).  ""Kiddie Breakfast"" for $4 = Pancake, egg, juice, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage!  (This would feed most adults).  I don't like giving low ratings to locally owned places run by nice people but this place is an institution and won't suffer from this review... worth a try if you're looking for a ton of food cheap and maybe get something besides the pancakes (and go when they're not busy).",-1,-1
Highly overrated.  The food was awful.  Service mediocre.  Hair in the food on top of it.  So disappointing.,-1,-1
I am a regular at this place.  I have eaten there at least once a week for 10 years. I have noticed that the service is getting worse and worse.  I always sit at the counter and you would expect that someone woulkd notice me.  Lately I have to ask other servers who are standing 2 feet away drinking coffee if someone could please just wait on me.  This is ridiculous.  I know some of the servers are new but still this is a basic restaurant skill.  I like the food OK and always leave a generous tip even if I have been ignored.  I think this institution is getting just too jaded to really care anymore.,-1,-1
"I have only been to this place one other time and I don't really remember that visit.  What I do remember is that it was crowded, it had long wait times, and they only accepted cash.  Five years later and none of that has changed.    I am simply not a fan of this place.  Upon walking in I was told the wait would be about ten minutes.  This doesn't seem too long until you realize that you are waiting those ten minutes shoulder to shoulder with people in their extremely small front waiting area with lovely freezing air blowing on you whenever the door opens.  When we finally got a table, I realized that it was sandwiched between another set of diners. I usually don't mind this but for some reason today I just couldn't deal with it. The man must hv noticed this because he saw two open seats at the bar and suggested we sit there instead; at this I gladly obliged.  There aren't individual menus outside of a huge menu on the wall.  I ordered the scramble with corn beef hash and onion; gravy on the side and no cheese.  It was not good.  The hot sauce that I drowned it in gave it all the flavor that the dish lacked; not a good sign.  The man ordered the corn beef and blueberry pancake. The corn beef was tasty but was unlike any corned beef I had ever seen.  The pancakes were way too sweet and seriously just too big.   All the things that I mentioned: cash only, small, and portion size are all things that people seem to really like about this place. Not me.  I prefer to use my card and a bit more of a modern setting. If I can't have that I at least want a place that serves good food and not supposed charm.  I will not be visiting this place again.",-1,-1
"Mickie's Dairy Bar is maybe one of the most disgusting and vile places I have ever eaten. I have been to Mickie's once on a Sat. morning. I ordered a large orange juice and one blueberry pancake. The pancake was burnt on one-side and underdone on the other. The garnish (a chintzy orange twist and parsley sprig; who has ever hear of a parsley garnish for a pancake?) had not one, but two fruit flies on it. The orange juice had ice in it, making it watered down. The service was terrible, seeing how none of the waiters were under the age of 50. Needless to say I will never, ever in my life go back again. Not even if someone paid me.",-1,-1
"Mickies did not live up the hype. It was busy and crowded so I expected the best, but unfortunately ended up with food poisoning from doughy and uncooked tasting pancakes.  Even the toast was limp and subpar.  The service was fine but I will not be going back for any of their food.",-1,-1
"I always think of Mickies as a must-go place when I am in town, but this time around, I questioned why that is the case.  The food was decidedly mediocre, not cheap and the wait was interminable.  My companion's omelet, ordered with pepperjack cheese, was served with cheddar sprinkled on top.  My mushroom and swiss omelet almost certainly was made with slimy canned mushrooms.  The fried cheese curds - which my every visit to Madison must include - were forgettable, sadly.  Even the coffee was not up to snuff.  At least the waitstaff was friendly and trying hard.",-1,-1
"I'm probably going to be shunned for this review...and granted, I wasn't here hungover on a weekend morning so I may have to give it one more shot sometime soon. But, if given a choice I would not make the trek to Mickies for breakfast food again.   I know, I know. It's practically treason to say that in Madison. But I have definitely experienced better. Hence the 2 stars.   Came here at 1 PM on a weekday for lunch with my co-workers. My boss was craving a milkshake so we made the hike over to Mickies. I had heard enough about the place so I wasn't expecting much as far as ambiance goes. It really is a dive bar/diner feel. Which I don't dislike, there's definitely a place for that kind of scene in the breakfast food scene. There was hardly anyone there so we were seated right away. Service overall was poor. Sure things came out quickly but our server was downright rude and inattentive. It was clear that it was the end of his shift and he was really upset that we had walked through the door.  On to the food, it was all a lot of meh. I ordered a scrambler with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. Topped with Cheddar cheese with the gravy on the side. First of all most of the potatoes at the bottom were burnt and practically inedible. Which was sad because the ones I did taste were pretty yummy. The eggs and everything in the actual scrambler were cooked well. But I'm pretty sure the mushrooms were out of a can which was disappointing. Cheese on top was shredded and hardly melted, gravy was okay but my dad makes better. Other people at my table seemed to enjoy their food just fine. The milkshakes received a ""pretty good""rating.   So, like I said, I'll probably give it one more shot when I'm hungover on a Saturday morning and craving greasy breakfast food. Maybe next time I'll try the pancakes instead. It honestly makes me sad to write this review because of the nostalgia of the place, but there are definitely better breakfast places in Madison.",-1,-1
Madison tradition but nothing great except the shakes.  Breakfast is heavy and not great.  The pancakes are big but doughy and not that great.  The scrambler is the best thing to get.  Don't wait in line for this place.,-1,-1
"So to start off I was out here for a 3 day business meeting and decided not to stay at the pricier hotel and would save a bit of money...horrible idea!   The rooms are not horrible but the beds are very uncomfortable, I was about to just sleep on the floor but went and drank more instead.  The air conditioning in the room is extremely loud and there is only two settings, on and off. If it's on then it feels like an ice box, and when it's off it feels like the sun! It was rough sleeping in the room with the ac on, but I guess that's what the free alcohol is for...  During my last night staying here, there was supposed to be some work done on the water system so water was supposed to be off between 2am-5am. I woke up at 7am to get ready for my last work meeting and there is no running water, that was very unfortunate. I couldn't shower, make coffee, brush my teeth, or flush the toilet (if you get what I'm saying).  I'm normally not a picky person and would always give the benefit of the doubt to anyplace, but if you can afford a nicer place then GO THERE!! For cheap college students that want to pack into a room and just need a place to close your eyes for a few hours then this is your place...the $3 black jack was pretty good as well.",-1,-1
"Haven't ventured here since the San Remo.    Came back this past weekend to beat the hoards of people at the MGM cab line, people, this one is worse.  10 groups ahead of us and took 30+ minutes.    No one wants to pick up the po' folk.  I believe the prices have gone up a bit since the change over, but I think it's a great bargain on the strip.  Rooms are decent and it's a short hop and skip away from MGM.  Of course, the other bright side is the NEON orange short shorts and the girls strutting in them.",-1,-1
"Can't be upset for what you get on a Saturday in Vegas for $50. The room was exactly as I expected a $50 room would be.... Outdated, small, not the cleanest but what do you expect? The bed was clean and comfy and the water pressure in the shower was excellent. Our toilet overflowed and ran all night, the elevator is a bit of a death trap and the casino is tiny. Ok for one night but that's about it. You get what you get.... Basic room with no frills.",-1,-1
The only reason they get two stars is for the restaurants. This place is definitely a dive. The shower had hair everywhere. Warning especially to the ladies...While in the bathroom I noticed light coming from the bathroom exhaust vent which didn't seem normal. I stood on the toilet and looked through the vent and I could see right into the bathroom of the next room over. Probably a good place to stay if you're a college kid but definitely not good for families and mature adults.,-1,-1
"Really would be a one star, except it has it's bright points (staff who try).    The good:  Cheap.  The bad:  Old dirty, smells like a fraternity after a beer brawl.  Could be a five star if you like cheap beer...",-1,-1
"This is barely better than the motel 6 next door. The beds are uncomfortable, rude staff, resort fee even though the pool was closed. Spend less and get off the strip to get a better hotel.",-1,-1
"Went here in Aug, very cheesy. What you expect from Hooters, enough said.",-1,-1
"Terrible service,  wings are not good and the girls aren't even that hot. Would highly recommend not coming here. I personally will never come back",-1,-1
"Place is super cheap and need tons of Upgrades. We thought we were getting a cheap price but came out to a lot. Extra fees like anywhere else. When we walked in the room the rugs looked so bad I didn't want to take my shoes off, sink was clogged, shower wasn't working and I found random hair on the bed. Walls are paper thin so you can hear everything... everything. Staff was nice and helpful. All in all you get what you pay for. I'll save my money for a nicer hotel.",-1,-1
"One star for its close proximity to the strip and affordable price. We stayed here in 2011 and came back in 2014, but the rooms in this hotel are so outdated and poorly maintained. The AC/heater mounted on the walls of our room sounds like a truck and we had to get up in the middle of the night to turn it off. We were exhausted for days until we moved to the Venetian. The bathtub has multiple dents and won't drain any water. Only half the water makes it to the shower head; the rest runs from the tub tap.  The anti-slip mat was so filthy I didn't even want to touch it. All of the above, the bathroom floor between the tub and the toilet is covered in sticky yellow gunk, which I think could be removed but they just didn't care to.  Blow dryer was broken and almost caught on fire when turned on. Even the posters in elevators were vandalized and the management didn't seem to mind it at all.  I wish I took a picture but we couldn't stand it any longer and left in such a hurry.   So in conclusion. If you are absolutely broke but want to stay close to the strip, go to hooters. But if you have just a little bit money to spend on your vacation, and you want to have a good memory of your stay in Vegas, go to another hotel. Nothing on the strip can be worse than this place.",-1,-1
"Stayed here back in 2014 and the main thing I have to say is, CHEAP! You pay for what you get.   Pros: check in was quick, pool was nice, one bartender was awesome when he looked at me and said,""looks like you need a Bloody Mary and a breakfast burrito""(hungover), it was delicious. Low pice on rooms with a hotel walking distance to the strip. Decent bed with clean sheets. Casino is small but has everything you need.   Cons: it's run down, old. Needs some renovation, updating, demolition. Wings? No good (to my taste) you'd be better with cooking frozen wings in a microwave. Food is mediocre (other than the breakfast burrito). If you're in a room over looking the pool, hope you enjoy noise. Tube TV and a game cube for ""entertainment"". Bathrooms are what you'd get at a cheap hotel. Sinks drained SLLOOWWWW...waiting for a taxi? It's quicker to walk to the MGM Grand and wait there.   All in all, it's what you pay for. Most of the time you're not in your hotel room, so I guess you can say it's alright for the price. Although I'm gonna upgrade to a better hotel.",-1,-1
"The price was very reasonable for three nights; thanks to Groupon  BUT the room was horrible.  The water didn't drain during our showers, ankle high water for a 5 min shower. Room service was no where to be found at times, even when we called. Walls super thin. Stains on the rug, holes in bathroom wall. Upgrades def needed.  It is what it is, we went to Vegas for a concert and my birthday so I wasn't planning on being inside of the room most of the time but I def expected more.",-1,-1
Wow got in late after a drive from Colorado so I was tired and there was a problem with my reservation at another hotel so being tired as I was I too the closest hotel and what a mistake. First it smelled terrible and I thought maybe if I take the upgrade that I might get a better room! It turns out that it was just a bigger smelly old run down room and thank god my family wasn't with me because there would be now way we would have stayed this place should be condemned,-1,-1
"This is a review of the restaurant inside.  Like so many others, my experience here consisted of questionable food and an unfriendly waiter, who didn't trouble himself to stop by our table even once to ask us if we wanted another beverage or anything else. He sure had time though to stand around looking bored, talking to his buddy near the back where I watched him do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes. So I decided to just walk up to the bar to get my own drink where I was met, eventually, by an ill-tempered gal who did nothing more than raise her eyebrows when I asked for a beverage. The chicken was overdone on the outside, underdone on the inside- shrimp like rubber. Straight up- this place is bad, stay away.",-1,-1
Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different.,-1,-1
"Worst Hotel Ever. Dirty carpet and restroom. Roaches and cricket we asked to be moved to another room, they didn't offer. We were move after we requested. They sent a man with a spray bottle, broom, and dust pan..no joke. The air conditioning in the first room didn't cool off the room. Both rooms had gross carpet and restrooms.",-1,-1
Bed bugs. Stay away!! At first you think it's just a cheap hotel.. You get what you pay for.. But not worth their unsanitary condition. Staff was nice but place was gross.,-1,-1
"I got food poisoning here just a couple of days ago when I was here for New Years. Maybe we sat across each other and didn't even know it, Kallie. I had the hot breaded wings with ranch and a vodka/ cranberry. The service was non-existent and/or cranky--I was never asked for a refill. However, I refilled the toilet several times New Years Eve thanks to Hooters.",-1,-1
"It's not too tough to find a good deal on rooms, but the hotel is not very good. Basically with this place, you get what you pay for. The bed was pretty comfortable, but the carpets throughout the place were very dirty. The bathroom was very old and not nice at all, but again, you get what you pay for.   The casino isn't too bad, and they have cheap beer.   If you're looking for a cheap place to sleep and don't care how nice it is, this is an ok option.",-1,-1
"The room is spacious and reminiscent of the one at Red Rock.  The overall food quality was good, but the variety was disappointing because the ethnic stations were closed as was the dessert section. I settled on a rather mundane breakfast of cooked-to-my specifications (thin) omelet, OJ, fruit, bacon and more fruit.",-1,-1
"Station Buffet has seriously downgraded over the last few months. Rotton Tomatoes in the Salad Bar with indifferent workers to take care of it. Casino is in serious financial difficulty (like most), however with the new lower prices I believe the Pigs at the nearby Pig Farm get  safer food than what is served here. If you eat at Station Buffets limit yourself to Red Rocks and Green Valley and know they have downgraded also.",-1,-1
"SHAKING MY HEAD.  So im kind of excited they got this 2 for 1 buffet promotion til the end of February. Of course you gotta have a player card to qualify for it. Since they are no longer a Station Casino, they trying to promote the heck out of their own namesake. So I take my fam and friends for a total party of 8. We get 4 player cards to take full advantage of the offer.   Its  friday, which is steak night and the line for the entrance is HELLA long. So we wait. After about 30 minutes later we sit. Im going straight for the steak and beef ribs!  Like a drunk dude tryin to skate up an icy hill, it's all fails from this point on. I get beef ribs, ribeye steak, sirloin steak, corn on the cob, and mashed potatoes.  1. The beef ribs were dry and very skimpy. I literally had to dump spicy barbeque sauce on them just to get any kind of flavor besides the smoke flavoring.   2. The ribeye steak was well done. Now, if you like steak flavored gum, this piece of rubber is for you!  3. The sirloin steak was the ribeye's evil twin brother. Nuff said.  Based off of what I just ate, I was afraid to even look at the corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. The corn was actually sweet and rather juicy. The mashed poatoes were tasty and the texture was consistant all through out. If you think about it, that's pretty sad if the sides are what is noteworthy.  So I get up to see if there is anything else decent that can satisfy my hunger. As I go to grab a plate, another fail presents itself. I see some people just standing there looking around. Turns out, there were no more plates. Say what? Another unexcusable fail. What restaurant runs out of clean plates? Better yet, a buffet even?   So to end my evening I decided to get salad since they had the small plates available for that. YES, I SAID SALAD! With this move I am totally contradicting myself by making fun of people who go to buffets just to eat salad. THIS IS THE LAST FAIL!  So in closing, I don't ever remember encountering so many fails at any kind of establishment. Dont get me wrong. I know I should be appreciative of the 2 for 1 promo which I was, but the fails were just too much. So for those of you that are reading this and just now got in line, DONT DO IT!",-1,-1
"Aww hell naw! Stay away,, keep ur money. The simple foods that I couldnt imagine a way for someone to mess up are all n here. Something as simple as a dinner roll, pretty much tastes like cardboard,, at least 2 me. I want my $8.99 back!",-1,-1
Not bad as far as price.... Food was ok.... Not the best but decent considering how cheap it is... Some food was seasoned perfectly ... Others were a little too salty for my taste ... The dessert was alright...,-1,-1
"Your Typical Station Casino Buffet set up....nice decor, but slim pickings on the food items...same food items were placed at the BBQ and carving stations, salad bar was pretty mediocre, and a lot of food items had that ""sitting on the buffet line too long and needed to be changed out"" look.   Of all the Station Casinos, the ones at Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock are your better bets. don't waste your time with the others...ALOHA!!!",-1,-1
"I've been here twice and both times I was disappointed. At dinner, everything was dry/stale like it had been sitting there all day. The fried shrimp were not deveined either. Gross. At breakfast, everything lacked flavor and the eggs were so watery I'm guessing they were made from powder.  I will not go back to this buffet. It's inexpensive, but even that couldn't make up for the state of the food.",-1,-1
"I've been to this buffet a couple of times previous when it was Station's Feast Buffet.  This was my first trip since the ownership changed.  This review is based upon a lunchtime visit.  The buffet was nice and clean and the wait staff were very friendly.  Now, for the food........  I'll start with what I thought was decent.  Most of the salad bar is just fine; there could be an expansion of the salad toppings and that would be a plus, but no real complaints here.  I did think the cold broccoli salad was pretty good.  Also, the selection of gelato is quite nice and tasty.  Now, for what definitely needs improvement:  The majority of the hot items are similar to what you would find in a high school cafeteria.  Seasoning is not in the cooking staff's vocabulary.  There are too many items that are deep fried and that just does not have a long holding time and hence the quality suffers.    All in all, I think I probably discarded 3 full plates of food that just wasn't worth eating.\  I still felt like I got my money's worth by taking a couple of trips through the cold salad bar and a number of plates from the dessert bar.",-1,-1
"We decided to give it another try last night since my aunt had some 2-for-1 coupons. It was their Friday night seafood buffet.   I skipped the oysters this time. The clam chowder barely had any clams. The shrimp cocktail were not fresh once again. The ceviche was ok. The beef tenderloin was really tough. The ginger crab in the asian section was ok.   We were here mainly for the ginger crab legs. I want to apologize to those who had to wait behind me as I was stacking ginger crab legs on my plate. I was getting about 12 deep on each plate, and I got at least 4 plates of ginger crab.  Our waitress was nice. Last time there was a waitress going around just to empty the crab shells off the tables, not last night though. Our table was always full of plates of empty crab legs.",-1,-1
Ok so I went to lunch and notthing spectacular..it was good..tasted like the other Indian casino buffets in Cali...what i dont get is they dont have ANY SHRIMP or SEAFOOD at lunch..really cheeziee.. I dont know how i ended up here again but lemi tell you about their breakfast..the best part of my breakfast was the omellette station where they cooked my 3 eggs over easy..the bacon was good..well its freakin bacon..they had some left over rice from last nite..it was crunchy..dunno y..the breakfast piizza??..you heard right..breakfast pizza..i would guess left over again.. they had turkey??left over also..wow..so i ordered punch..it tasted like they mixed it with chalk..so I ordered ice tea..it just left me with a funny aftertaste..so i decided to just stay thirsty..they had assorted donuts..k.. this could compare to Circus Circus buffet...or...4th st in LA where they feed the homeless...,-1,-1
Everytime I come here I always tell myself ill never come back. After a while I forget and then I go and am reminded of why I didn't like it in the first place. Their smoothies are too thick and are pricey. Not for me.,-1,-1
Only 2 ppl working and a long line. After waiting for 10+ one drink was ready but the other never got made. After asking where the drink was all we got was oh sorry I forgot from the cashier and had to pay again.... Ugh,-1,-1
"Acai smoothie and breakast spinach wrap - no complaints. The employees were cordial and service was timely.  Just don't exit onto Decatur during peak traffic hours - ""small kine busy"".",-1,-1
"Dowloaded a coupon for a buy one get one free from the jamba juice website. Try to use it and get told that it was used two days ago in California so I can't use it here. Doesn't seem to matter that the coupon wasn't even good then. Date on it was for today. So try to explain this and get told that ""once one person somewhere in the country uses a coupon anywhere in the country that no one else anywhere can use them. That it what the self proclaimed ""general manager"" said. I am pretty sure that is not accurate. He just argued that ""this happens to people all the time and he already started making the smoothies so we HAD to pay for them both.  This place is ridiculous and I will 100 percent never come back to this location or any other location for that matter. What a joke. ""One person in the country gets to use the coupon"". So after that crap explanation of nothing I say screw it and pay for two smoothies. Both identical. Both larges. What did I get you ask? I got two different size cups. One large and one medium. So yet again I ask the "" general manager "" why they are different sizes and he just stared at me. I asked again and all he could come with is ""different smoothies have different sizes! I point out they are identical drinks and he says "" nothing I can do now they are already made. I point out I paid for two larges yet again and he says ""very sorry, nothing I can do"". So now this place has taken money from me and not given me what I paid for and the boss man says that is company policy. So company policy is if an employee makes the wrong drink that's on the customer. Horrible.",-1,-1
"Never heard of store say ""cant take your order because were short staffed"". At least tell me that you will be helping me as soon as your done.  There were literally 4 customers in the entire place.  I  left because i wasnt sure how long  ""cant take your order now"" meant.  I work in the area and we always come here.  Not good jamba juice hopefully you hire better workers that can multitask.",-1,-1
"I don't normally go to Cherry's to get my nails done, but since I couldn't get an appointment at my normal nail salon in Pacific Mall, I decided to give her a try.  It was the worst manicure experience I've ever had. I had a picture opened right on my phone of what I wanted done and when she didn't even have the correct colours and I politely requested it to be redone, she was very rude about making her ""redo her job"". From that moment until the rest of my manicure she was very impatient with me and did a really bad job with my nails, also being really rough on my hands. It was one of the most expensive manicures I've paid for but it was the worst quality one I've ever gotten; she did not shape my nails properly - my square tips are on a slant, crystals were off centre and the sides were poorly filed. I had to refile myself when I got home. She overcharged and then without telling me there was a cost, she redid 3 of my fingers with gel extensions because she broke off my original acrylic ones while buffing them off. She was dishonest about the prices and provides really bad customer service. My friend's shellac nails was bumpy afterwards, didn't even have a smooth service. I will never go back and I suggest anyone who is looking for a pampering manicure service to not go to Salon Plus because you will be disappointed.",-1,-1
"Service is quick and staff are very polite. However.. I will not be returning. I wasn't happy with my nails, they were VERY rushed and I'm not very happy with the finished product.   I paid $45 for gel nails with a ombré.. the sides of my nails look unfinished and I had to ask the girl doing it to clean under the nail since she rushed so much to file them the after ""nail dust"" was still there.. I would not recommend them to anyone even for the price. I would've rather gone to my regular spot and paid +$100 for the same design and it would've been expensive but they would've done a much better job and take more time to do it.   Save your money and head to another salon.",-1,-1
"I haven't been to see Cherry since last November because I've been super busy with work and just haven't had the time to haul myself up to Steeles & Kennedy to get my nails done.  My natural nails have completely grown out so I needed to have a new fullset done. I had a remaining package visit left so I booked an appointment last Thursday and went to get something fun and glittery done! She seemed a bit rushed and laid the gel on thick and unevenly and was finished in about 40 minutes - even the cheap nail bars take about an hour, so that should have been my first clue that something wasn't right.  The design was pretty, but when I went home I noticed right away that the gel didn't go all the way to the base of my nail and 2 days later at work I banged my nail into a drawer and the entire gel chip came right off! In all my years of having gel nails done this has never happened! Upon closer inspection it seems that my natural nail wasn't roughed up very much so the gel didn't adhere properly. I also noticed hat my natural nail tips seemed to be curling away from the gel tips (that's the only way I can describe what it looks like, but basically the gel and the nails were separating). I lost another gel chip 2 hours later into my shift so that night I was able to PEEL of the rest of my nails with little effort.   Anyone that has ever had gels or acrylics knows that they need to be removed either by filing or soaking in acetone and should never PEEL off!   I've used up my package visits for Salon Plus and seeing as Beatrice Y had a similarly disappointing experience I probably won't be going back any time soon.",-1,-1
"I'm looking for a good & reasonable price nail place around the GTA area as well. I've done mines a few times in HK & it was great for the price, quality & amount of details I had! So far, I've only been to one girl who works from home & she does a good job, but it was not like the ones I've got done in HK. The quality is good as mine have lasted 1 month & it's not too thick. Her painting design skills was a little on the sloppy side, however I', not sure if she was in a rush! Her price is comparable to the ones at Pmall or splendid china, which I didn't like since she has no overhead rent.",-1,-1
"Went to bowl.... no lanes available so we took advantage of the happy hour drink prices. They have a mojito for $6 so I said I'll take a coconut mojito.... had 2, got the bill and it was $40.... for 2 drinks! I said it was incorrect, waiter said he'd fix it. Came back and said I had 2 martini charges as well.. I don't drink martinis! Said this is still incorrect! He said he would fix it again went over brought the bill back didn't think anything of it signed the ticket and left ...they charged me an additional five dollars. I would never go to this place again if my life depended on it!! stay as far away as you can",-1,-1
Very unorganized when it comes to getting people in the venue.  Standing only.  Sound system is great but I will never step foot in this venue again unless they provide seats and tables for all attending.,-1,-1
"Sorry to say but as much as I really like the place as a music venue; I was extremely disappointed with the food.  We ordered their renowned world famous fried chicken and the Chile Rubbed Ribeye steak. I've had the fried chicken before at Blue Ribbon Sushi in NY and at The Cosmo here in Vegas. This was not the same. I actually think they might have forgotten to double dip it in the batter.  The skin coating was kind of thin and not that crispy. The ribeye was just plain fatty and chewy. Additionally, although I ordered it ""Medium"" it was clearly delivered ""Rare"". I might give the fried chicken another chance due to its reputation but the ribeye was clearly an inferior/cheap cut they are serving.  And although they have only 8 or 10 tables outside I enjoy al fresco dining this time of year in Vegas.  I do really enjoy the entertainment and feel of the place. I've already seen 3 live shows here and look forward to seeing a few more.  Maybe even doing some bowling next time.",-1,-1
I've been to a concert almost every month at the Brooklyn Bowl in the past year. Tonight was one of the most disappointing concert experiences I have ever had. I was so excited to see Jack White; received the tickets as a birthday gift. An employee shared that the show was oversold by 400 tickets. They weren't joking- it was packed. It was impossible to move around and if you were under 6 foot tall- good luck seeing anything. I spent 30 minutes looking for a spot to actually see something and my only luck was on a TV screen in the front bar.   I didn't pay $75 to watch live music on a TV screen. Mentioned something to security- they didn't have anything to say in return.,-1,-1
Worst security ever!!!  They feel they have the right to put their hands on you!  Coming up from behind and grabbing you?!?!?  They shouldn't ever put their hands on you unless you are fighting... But they are agro and aggressive!!!,-1,-1
This place looks nice but had the worse service ever. Didn't even get a chance to see around due to the worse service,-1,-1
"So, all the reviews are pretty good and I was so excited to go spend my 40th birthday & $$ here with a few others, but kind of got turned off by their so-called rules!  So, I wanted to reserve a lane for Saturday night-just in case- It was great deal, BUT the catch is they will not honor their ""Spare Time Happy Hour"" for the night if I reserve the lane, only if we walk in?!?!  Hello, does that make any sense?  I was told we needed to spend min. of $150 on food and drink--ok cool---but we are going to pay double what everyone else pays (food & drinks) because I was thinking ahead and made a reservation!!??!!  Just makes no sense to me....Guess this is just a Vegas thing---I'm assuring you that I will spend at least $150, but that doesn't work because I am not just walking in off the street?!?!?!  So, if you plan to reserve a lane, don't plan on taking advantage of their ""Late Night Happy Hour Dance Party"" they advertise on their flyer!!  There is always a catch...if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!",-1,-1
"We went there for dinner before going on the High Roller.  The hostess told us to seat ourselves and we did.  No one ever came to give us a menu, take or orders or anything.  After more than 10 minutes, we went back to the hostess and her response was that she guessed there was no one serving the patio section.  Not cool.  She seated us inside, but the music was crazy loud.  The waiter came over and we could not hear anything he said and he could not hear us.  We went back out to the patio and he served us some hummus (yes, we had to pay for it).  I was interested in the smoked trout salad or the Greek salad, but he didn't know anything about them.  In short, the service was poor and the venue was way too loud.  The patio was nice.   We ended up having to skip dinner since all of this took so long.  We went to the High Roller and had a great time.  We had a very nice date night regardless, but we will not be returning to the Brooklyn Bowl.  It's unfortunate since we went to the one in Brooklyn in January with friends and had a good time.",-1,-1
"Pretty disappointing. I was curious about what the Linq had to offer, and if this is it, I am concerned.  We went on a Saturday night and although bowling was advertised outside, we were unable to even enter the bowling area- it looked like a group had rented it out. There was ample seating around the bars, which was nice, but the drinks were expensive and mediocre at best. In fact, the mojito crossed from mediocre to un-drinkable. For those prices I would rather go next door to Yardhouse where there is a far better drink selection, not to mention some yummy appetizers.",-1,-1
"I will try to be brief.   Do NOT EVER purchase ""Club Level"" tickets. Basically never buy tickets to view the show from upstairs. Its an absolute rip off.  You will risk the chance of not being able to view the show at all.   If you go to the bar and leave your spot you are done. Im not even talking about coming back and being able to kinda see. No, you CANT. You lose your spot at the barrier and you are DONE!  I tried to bring it up to the staff very politely and they said ""well you knew it was limited viewing"" (which btw it is NOT stated in the website at all). And also, since when limited viewing means NO viewing at all?   Listen I hate complaining let alone wasting my time whining on yelp but Im trying to help people out there that are serious about watching their favorite band.   Save yourself some money. DONT purchase anything higher than GA if any. It ain't worth it.   I left the concert half way through. I raised the concerns to management and staff and they couldn't care less. Lost $150 for that crap.  Don't waste money at this venue. Especially for anything nicer than GA tickets.",-1,-1
"Las Vegas is all about maximizing the customer experience.  The Brooklyn Bowl does just the opposite.  Please avoid this poorly managed tourist trap.  Their favorite trick is to be intentionally deceptive about the start time of their shows.  The rest of the civilized world uses the qualifiers ""show time"" or ""doors open"" to communicate clearly to their customers.  Not so at the BB where they make the ridiculous claim that it's ""technically impossible"" to be honest in their advertising and on their tickets.  Their misguided strategy, apparently, is to bring people in for what they think is an 8pm show and then surprise them with the news that nothing will happen until 930pm.  I suppose they think that this pathetic sleight of hand will persuade you to sit down and enjoy their very marginal food and drink--reviewed on Yelp separately and not so positively  When you discuss this issue with ""management,"" they acknowledge that they get complaints, but why should customer feedback force any reflection?  It must be because the customer just does not matter.    Be a good customer and go where you will be appreciated--I can assure you that the BB is not the place for that.",-1,-1
"Great concept. Poor execution. Very overpriced. The place looks great.The staff really doesn't seem to know what is going on. We went to see a show and for months they couldnt tell me about renting a lane. We did a VIP Meet & Greet and they didn't know the time or where it would be held hours prior to the show starting. When they did figure it out, they had us hanging outside in 100+ degree heat for about an hour with no shade. The sound isn't that great and $12 for a shot of fireball? $750 to rent a lane for a show? On a positive note: the food was really good! I would stop by to eat and have a few cocktails, but I wouldn't bother seeing a concert here.",-1,-1
"The place is visually appealing and its so unfortunate that the staff was so disorganized and rude. We asked the bartender a question about the taste of a particular food & the response was ""I don't know order them and you'll find out""! and after ordering our group was offered other patrons food order 3 different times because the waiter was not sure of who placed the ordered.   The place was pretty empty so no reason why the bartender had to ask us 3 times a simple 3 beer and 1 mix drink order...well if he would have finished helping us before he started a conversation with someone else, walked away from the bar and try to fill other orders before allowing us to provide our order then it might have been easiest to remember and fulfill...we didn't receive flatware or even napkins with our order...",-1,-1
"Maybe hiring people that care and not some people with no life experience that could care less about what a person is looking to accomplish for their first time at Brooklyn bowl.  Like maybe taking the payment information correctly, paying attention when people ask questions and not getting annoyed you should consider dropping Brooklyn from your name your nothing like the old neighborhood stick to your west coast way of doing business: don't care, don't know, whatever and last but not least no work ethic oh and yes telling the customer about a coworkers vacation and your vacation and blaming not they other employee for lack of action",-1,-1
"Please don't ever go to Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas. I was accused of stealing a poster out of a enclosed storage and the only compensation was a free beer. If it wasn't for another random guest vouching for me, I would have been kicked out. I will NEVER support that venue again.  We spent about $250 in fees in a bowling lane and food and drinks. Needless to say, the embarrassment alone is enough to never go back. It's just unfortunate that the night had to end in sick lackluster service.",-1,-1
"Awful service and complete idiot security guards.  Terrible food, complete disaster of a place for Las Vegas, how embarrassing!",-1,-1
"I am not one to usually complain about walmart. But I am seriously so freaking tired of all of the employees using the family bathroom! Do you bring your family to work? No, I don't think so. Meanwhile, I am waiting outside the door with my very impatient 11 month old, for 20 mins while you take a dump and update your Facebook status.",-1,-1
Here it is 4 years later and they continue to be the worst of all the other Walmarts. Popular items are never in stock and sometimes they no longer stock them so you have to go another location anyway.  They need new management.,-1,-1
"The absolute worst customer service at this store....I had purchased a floor mat from this location and accidentally left it behind in the cart..I decided to call the customer service department to see if it may have been found in the lost and found items and if there was anything I could do to replace it. I was told on the phone by a customer service representative by the name of Chelsea to bring our receipt into the store and they would replace it for us. I made sure to advise her that it was my fault as I had left the floor mat in the cart outside as I was loading groceries and wasn't sure if that would make a difference or not, but she continued to tell me to come back in and she would replace it. I made the trip back to the store to be rudely greeted by the customer service department manager named Heather. I told her that I spoke with Chelsea (who happened to be at the desk as well) and informed her of my situation. She told me in the worst tone of voice ""there's nothing I can do because it was outside."" I then informed her that Chelsea had told us that this wouldn't be a problem. To which she responded with ""you probably talked to someone that doesn't know what they're even doing.""...I stood there completely shocked. I told her that I made the trip back for this promised purpose and she stood there and shrugged. I don't mind that the mat wasn't replaced, I just wanted to acknowledge the horrible attitude problem that the customer service manager had given to me. I will be calling the store manager, Glennda Kirk, tomorrow to inform her of this issue as well. I will definitely be sticking to Target and Fry's from now on!",-1,-1
"I keep odd hours so sometimes I'm grocery shopping very late. This particular night, the only registers that were open was the self check out. I like the self check out when I have a few times. But when you have an entire cart load, that's not gonna work. There were others with full carts too. I had to ask to have a register opened and they opened another one...and they were nice about it...but .... Really?!  Self check out only?!?!  I almost just decided to leave my groceries!",-1,-1
Terrible parking situation and always out of the Awake tea drinks.  Why don't they maybe stock more of their product.,-1,-1
This Starbucks is always too busy and you can never be taken care of in a timely matter. I do not recommend going inside. It's pure chaos and it will only make you angry. I do still go through the drive thru but knowingly that I will wait 20 minutes no matter what time of day (and I usually go around 2:30ish) only because it's on my way to pick up my kids from school after work. And I'm busy in line in my car still finishing up work so then I don't feel it's so much of a waste of time.,-1,-1
"Horrible parking, slow drive up windows. Interior of shop is dirty, crowded and had a fair share of freeloaders using WiFi without ordering, all the while taking up table space of actual customers. Received wrong order, then they corrected the order got a horrible cup of bitter coffee (latte)..wound up throwing it away. Tried again at a drive up window a week later. Again, got the wrong order and yet another cup of bitter latte..do they EVERY wash the coffee pots/machines here? Why is this the only Starbucks serving bitter crap!?! Run from this place..the worst Starbucks in AZ!!",-1,-1
"This is literally the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. I have to be at work at 6:00 AM at High Street. I stopped in at 5:50AM on Tuesday 10/20/15. The woman who took my order was rude and would not let me finish speaking before asking questions about the drink I ordered. I asked for a grande ICED caramel macchiato layered with breve. Once she finally got my order I stood there for ten minutes while the 4 women working there did basically nothing, with the exception of the young lady working the drive thru. The ""barista"" that finally decided to make my drink was dumbfounded as to what layered was. Seriously? Macchiatos are supposed to be layered!! And I was handed a hot drink when i asked for iced. This literally made me cry on my way to work as I was now ten minutes late. I will never come back here and will tell everyone I know never to come here either.",-1,-1
ugh if they could get the drink right more than once it would be okay  it's like they don't even care - next oh is your drink wrong sorry - next what you want me to make it right - next please wait again while I remake it after all these other drinks - next,-1,-1
"Great friendly customer service! However, overall restroom facility cleanliness is less than par. My impression is that there isn't a focus on mopping the floors, or frequent checks on housekeeping. Just an FYI.",-1,-1
"Ordered a java chip frap for my niece and I, no java chips in our frap. Also our drinks were ready and sitting in the counter by the drive thru but we still waited about 5 mins for them to be given to us. My least favorite Starbucks by far.",-1,-1
This Starbucks is busy because of its location. The reason for our two star review is that they need to update this location's hours on yelp and on google. Google says it closes at 10:30pm on Saturdays. Yelp says 9:00pm. The door says 10:00pm and that is their actual closing time. We googled it and drove out of the way only to find a closed door at 10:04. Please update the hours and keep them updated. We are Starbucks addicted and need to knowwwww,-1,-1
One star is all they deserve. My coffee always tastes like pure water no coffee in it. Plus one of the girls seems like she had no clue what she's doing. Charged me for a drink she messed up. Ughhhh,-1,-1
"Never going back to this location!!!  Every time we have gone there (which was a lot and the closest one to us) they mess up our drinks!!! Carmel macchiato without the carmel. Pumpkin spice lattes didn't taste right flavors were missing!! Carmel frappuchino tasted like a whole different drink!! Ask for iced they make hot, ask for hot they make iced!!! White chocolate mocha was a regular mocha!!!   Horrible baristas......Never makes the drinks right!!!!",-1,-1
"Sadly, I just had the worst experience here and can no longer frequent this store.  After there was a system error with the mobile app and my order unknowingly went through twice, I got to the store and they had 2 drinks.  I tried to explain to the barista that I only ordered 1 and what might've happened, but she just shoved the drinks to me and said ""now you have 2.""  When I asked if she could fix it, she just said Nope. While I appreciate that the mobile app is not their problem and I can see why baristas hate it, customer service is their business. It doesn't take any extra money or time to be kind and at least let me know how to contact the right department about mobile app issues.   I know you're a busy store and won't notice, but I won't be back.",-1,-1
"I won't go to this Starbucks location again. I usually drive through and have been here dozens of times. One day, my son needed to use the restroom so we went inside. The restrooms were filthy. Makes me never want to go to this location again. I'll stick to the Starbucks in Grayhawk on Thompson Peak Pkwy.",-1,-1
"Stopped in late afternoon on Saturday and couldn't believe how dirty it was, from the restroom, to the tables, to the floor in front of the register.  They weren't busy at all, nor were they understaffed - I saw three people working. I was about to say something to one of the baristas, but she started shoving food in her face, so I realized that she really didn't care. Never going back to this location!",-1,-1
I hate Starbucks so much. If regulars come in then they put there drinks before anyone else's. I waited 20 minutes for 2 drinks while people behind me got their drinks way before mine. Never coming back again. Worst service ever. I'm sticking to Dutch bros.,-1,-1
Why is this always the slowest Starbucks ? 20 min and counting at drive through for one small frappucino - at least twice I have ordered a sandwich waited forever hen when pulling up I hear we are all out --grrrrr,-1,-1
"Worst service of any Starbucks I've ever been to. I never write negative reviews, but I have received awful customer service twice...same person...  When u run out of the sandwich I have a coupon for, why can't I use my coupon for a replacement sandwich? That's absurd and poor customer service that employees aren't either empowered to help or just plain too lazy to help. So disappointing!",-1,-1
"Starbucks, I'm talking to you. You regularly get orders wrong.  Today, my daughter ordered an unsweetened iced coffee for me and when she got home and gave it to me it was so sugary it could have been used as syrup. She said the order screen in the drive-thru read unsweetened.  I know she checked because of past problems with orders. I called and you cheerily said the next drink will ""be on us."" No, it isn't because I already paid for one I can't drink.  You're four miles from my house and always have a line.  So, your solution is to inconvenience me twice.  How is that adequate? I always tip your batistas at least 30%, and get no positive karma from you. Hence the negative review on Yelp.",-1,-1
I may have had the worst cup of coffee at this Starbucks. This visit made me make a commitment not to schedule any business meetings at any Starbucks again.,-1,-1
"I'm not a local and was just visiting Phoenix on business. This location was laid out oddly and there were two lines when I began to wait. I should have known better as most Starbucks locations have a single line with two cashiers punching them out during peak hours. Anyhow, as I approached the register my group of second liners was getting the stink eye from what looked like the ""real"" line. Being polite I asked the group, ""so, I am guessing our line is incorrect,"" and one guy responded. ""Yea man, this area here has always been where the line forms....,"" he blurted out. My response was a shoulder shrug as I placed my order. I had been waiting in line for five minutes at this point, the same as him, so I figured I was entitled to place my order. In my opinion the staff should have directed us instead of letting us pile into a second line avoiding the ugly stares and head shaking. The cashier failed to give me a receipt and seemed annoyed when I asked for it. Traveling on business means I am expensing my $5 coffee today. After a few minutes she had to get a manager to reprint, so I told her to forget it.",-1,-1
"Longest wait times!! 15 minutes in the drive thru is not ok!  The baristas here seem to be less than thrilled to service their customers.   Obviously those who frequent Starbucks will continue to do so, this particular location is just a bad representation.",-1,-1
"Ugg! Why do I even try with this location anymore?!?!?  This one I have had the worst experiences at. Tonight, I finally am annoyed enough to write here and calling the store in the morning.  I was only car in drive thru (imagine my shock!) , ordered Venti iced Pumpkin Chai Latte. Got to window, she read my order back, reloaded my card and the kid behind made the drink. Teens/20 something, Blonde hair, tall boy with no name tag. He hands me the drink with loaded whipped cream. I instantly take a sip and its horrible, he made a Pumpkin Spice Latte (sorry PSL drinkers, its just not my cup of tea). He offers to remake. Another car is now behind me. Second drink, I pull forward and take a sip, super strong and bitter, with after taste of burnt espresso. I pull over and park, go into store and let him know I would just like my money back as I am now running late to work. He says he'll remake it. I told him taste strongly of espresso and he said, ""Oh you didn't want espresso in it?"" I told him no. As he is looking for box cutters, he restocks the Tazo Chai bin with the new Tazo box of chai. He then starts to make my drink. He fills it with the pumpkin syrup, chai and milk to the middle line of the cup, then the rest with ICE. There is still a solid inch from the top of the lid. He grabs the whipped cream and I told him, ""No whip please "" and he proceeds to scoop out the dash he had started with a lid. I tell him that little bit is fine, that I must go and he tells me I need to let them know if I don't want whip cream because the chai comes with whip. I replied that's the first time I have heard that and have been asked at other starbucks if I wanted whip added and his response, ""well then they don't  know how how to make it."" Dude! YOU just had to remake my drink 3 times! I think I am finally done going to this location. I paid almost $6 dollars for not even a full drink and it still does not taste right and is not being super watered down with all the ice.",-1,-1
"So packed - jeebus!. Drive Thru was nearly to Tatum..not only was I late to work, my dirty chai came out not so chai...more like hazlenut. I had no time to get my order fixed, so I finished it. By the way Dirty Hazlenut lattae might be my new favorite coffee lol - Thanks?",-1,-1
I give this location no stars cuz they are horrible at there job took them 15 min to make a latte and my girlfriends iced coffee taste horrible!,-1,-1
"This Starbucks staff is awful. They are poor with customer service, they are sloppy and hand me dripping drinks every single day in the drive thru. They get my drink wrong often. They aren't very nice except for a few of them. I wouldn't stop here ever if there was another Starbucks on my way to work",-1,-1
"I am a Starbucks lover, I am not upset with the company, only the employees at this location. I ordered 2 drinks and 2 pastries. I was not offered a receipt and the cashier tried to keep my Gold Membership card like it was a maxed out gift card. Both drinks were made wrong and only one pastry was handed out. When I went back to ask for the other pastry they said I had never ordered it. Since I was never given a receipt I could not prove that I had purchased it. I didn't have them fix anything because I don't think they would have been capable.",-1,-1
Most dangerous Starbucks! Drive through is very slow and people think nothing of backing up the line all the way on to Tatum. Very busy location that results in very long wait times in the morning even if you mobile order.,-1,-1
This starbucks is awful. They don't listen when you're ordering don't apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time. Their rude and unworthy of my business.,-1,-1
"Seriously the WORST Starbucks I have ever been to. The lady in the drive through was so rude. She couldn't get my phone app to scan (even though I go to Starbucks almost daily and have never had anyone else have issues scanning).  She must have been really pissed about it taking her so long to finally get it to scan because when she handed me my drink, she didn't even lean out of her window. She could tell I was struggling to lean out my car window to reach the drink, yet she just kept her hand in the same spot instead of leaning two inches out of her window. This is not the first time I have experienced horrible customer service from this location. Seriously, don't waste your time and effort coming here.",-1,-1
Worst Starbucks ever. You have to stay in line even if you ordered through the app. The other option is to go front and yell can I pick up my order which has been sat there for 8 minutes now and it is getting cold... someone might hear you and give you your coffee. I'm never coming back here. Have given them enough chance.,-1,-1
Bad service. Always out of stuff on a busy morning.... How can you run out of bold blend at 7:30 am. This is my third tint it happens. No sincere apology or offer a free drink for next time...,-1,-1
"They messed my drinks few times already. Last few months, I ordered white mocha online. They didn't put white mocha in my drinks two consecutive days. When I noticed something wrong with my drinks, I was already on my way to work. I couldn't bring them back. I decided not to use mobile order in the third day. I went to the store, put my order and told them what they had done. Everything went fine after that. Last month, I had problem a again with my drinks. And of course, they made mistake two consecutive days. Again, I went inside, told them what they had done. They apologized and everything went Okai till yesterday. I ordered white mocha online. They gave me a drink without espresso. Fortunately, I could come back this time. I asked one of the girls working there if I ordered it wrong. She confirmed that I ordered it right but they made it wrong. They remake my drink. Fine! I left my wrong drink and picked up the right one. This morning, I put the same order. I picked up my drink, checked before leaving the store, and of course again, there was not espresso in my drink. I asked the girl the fix it. After all, I hoped there was no more problem with my ""fixed"" drink. I had my first taste after 15 minutes away from the store. Of course, there was no espresso in my fixed drink. I couldn't believe what just happened. I called and let them know what they just did. The girl who made my drink told me I ordered it wrong.... How could I order it wrong? I asked them yesterday, and they confirmed that I ordered it right... anyway, she told me she would put my name in the book, and I can come back and get one ""free drink"" I come back tonight, asked if I can have store credit for my drink. I will use for my mobile order in the morning as my convenience. The girl told me she can't give me store credit. They told me tomorrow morning I have to call them 30 minutes ahead to order my free drink.  Okai. This is my frustration. It is not free drink because I didn't get what I paid for in the morning. I paid for what they call ""free drink"" They should make it more convenient for me. And also, they would not have to give me free drink if they make my drink right from the first time. ALL I NEED IS MY DRINK IS MADE RIGHT. I don't wanna come back to ask for my right drink second or third time, and be treated as someone asked for free drink.  Another detail upset me. When I come back tonite, the girl told me she would not surprise if they messed up my drink in the morning because they are way too busy. Is that the sign of ""this happens all the time. Don't be surprised if you didn't get what you order for"" wowww... shocked me!!!",-1,-1
I ordered a Cold Brew and have been waiting for over 5 minutes. There is no one in line and 6 staff walking around. It is really a joke since cold brew is already Brewed!!!!  Wow service is simply the worst I have ever experienced. Still waiting. Amazing that the cashier who took my order ended up pouring cold brew into a pitcher that just sat there full. Imagine the concept that she could have poured mine into a cup and served me!,-1,-1
Love Starubucks coffee but hate this location.  Always extremely busy and the people working at this particular one are always so rude and short with customers.  Will go out of my way to go to another Starbucks that offers a more pleasant experience.,-1,-1
"This place is terrible. They are always unprepared, slow and just unpleasant to do business with.  I am an avid starbucks customer and this is the worst location I have ever visited.",-1,-1
Busy and slow.  Every time I come here it's pretty packed and it seems like it takes forever to get my order.  On top of that it's the always-questionable Starbucks quality/flavor that's a 3-star on their best day.,-1,-1
The worst drive through.  Always take at least 20 mins.  They need to hire more staff because this is just taking too long,-1,-1
"This Starbucks is awful. It's so slow and my drink order has been wrong the four times I've been here. Ask for no sweetener they give it to you. Ask for a venti you get the size smaller. They aren't exceptionally friendly either. The inside(I went in one day to see if it's faster) is fairly clean but lacks seating. The inside may be a tad faster ordering. The parking lot is typically a zoo. I tried to go in one day and nicely let the girl know that my order has been wrong every time and while she was receptive of my concerns, here I am with the wrong drink again. I won't be back and if I'm desperate enough to I'm tasting my drink before I leave the window, which probably won't help their incredibly slow line.",-1,-1
"Went in last week and ordered my DECAF espresso shots on ice. Drank some of it and started feeling very sick, heart racing, shaking, had to call my husband to come get me and follow me home because they gave me regular espresso......didn't make it home had to pull over and leave car in lot and come back 4 hours later, tried to flush it out of my system, blood pressure soared to 198/98....what a horrible feeling. Thanks for not following the order.....",-1,-1
Very slow!! Mobile order and took 10 mins to get with an estimated 3 mins. Then order wrong 2x. I have never had problems with any location before. Won't be back to this one.,-1,-1
"Tried them 4 times since moving out to Desert Ridge. Each time I've been there I've received the incorrect drink each time. The label on the cup is correct but what they put in it is wrong. Also, seems as though they don't use their instruments properly as their drinks are always watered down as well. Super gross!",-1,-1
"Slowest Starbucks we have ever been to. Staff has never been that friendly. It's a convenient location, but it always ends up costing us more time than it's worth. Today, I ran inside to get two drinks because the drive-thru was 6+ cars deep. The inside line was completely empty, meaning I ordered immediately. It still took ten minutes to get my two drinks. This is not the first time this has happened, which is what prompts my review. I am normally a positive reviewer. When I'm paying almost $5 for flavored water (refresher), I have higher standards. We gave it a chance today because I even warned my husband about how slow it was before we drove there. However, I think we're finished with chances. There are plenty of other Starbucks.",-1,-1
I go to Starbucks every day and this is the worst I've I have ever been to. Slammed and employees are rushed and rude. Did not feel the welcoming Starbucks experience at all. A shame.,-1,-1
"I stop at this Starbucks almost weekly because it's the most convenient location on my way to work. Even when the lines are long, I still usually get through fairly quickly. However, this morning and several other times in the past, I will get my coffee and notice the cup feels lighter than it should. So when I got to work, I pulled the lid off and the cup was barely half full. I'm usually in a hurry going through the drive so I don't have time to address it as it happens, but seriously, this coffee is to expensive for them to only be filling the cups up half way.",-1,-1
"Not at all friendly. Amanda did not give me a sticker for my trenta green tea. Grouchy, Grouchy, Grouchy.",-1,-1
"I've gotta say, after reading the reviews I went in expecting a good quality, greasy spoon type of meal.  The wait was short and the place was packed.  The staff was efficient and very friendly.    The food however left something to be desired.  The pancakes, while properly cooked and of good size were flavorless to a point they were not to be helped by the poor quality maple-ish syrup.  The potatoes were...  well...  potatoes, unseasoned, nothing special.  They have some fun combinations for their omelets but anything stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing is going to taste good.  We did have a malt on the side which was under-malted and over milked.    I cannot understand why the place is so popular with a Madison crowd usually so sophisticated in its tastes.  The place really has nothing special to offer.  Maybe it's due to the fact when you're hung over on Saturday morning you just can't tell how mediocre it is.  If you changed the name and moved it to a different part of town It wouldn't last more than a few months.  I don't think I'll be back.",-1,-1
"Mickies used to be one of my favorite places in the world to eat. I used to go multiple times a week.  Now, the management seems exhausted and not very pleased to see you. The food has gone down in quality, the water cups taste like soap, the coffee is always awful , and on top of that they don't even refill your coffee after two servings.  You get your check and they expect you to leave...excuse me I'm here for food and a conversation. It would make sense on a game day to get kicked out but not in the summer when there's barely anyone there. Is this a diner? Or just some place that was featured on ESPN, thus leading to management caring less about their locals and regulars.   I won't be back. I'll go to the curve, pay more, and be happy about it.",-1,-1
"Note that this review is solely for the pancakes (specifically the banana nut ones). If you go there, get something else. After all, other reviewers seem to like this place okay. Each pancake was like a thick slab of cardboard. They were way too dry. You could barely choke them down, and when I drenched them in syrup to try and moisten them up (to the point where the syrup was nearly overpowering), it was still too dry. Once again, I don't know about the other food, but go somewhere else for pancakes.",-1,-1
"I'm with Onotse and Kelsi on this one, I just am not a fan. I've been to Mickie's a few times now, trying to give it a few chances to redeem itself in my eyes. Unfortunately, I find the food too greasy and just not that flavorful. I also think the portion sizes are ridiculously large. Normally I like big portions, but I really don't think eggs reheat or keep well as leftovers, so in this case it is a downside.  The atmosphere is a bit crazy, as it's always super busy, and the food simply doesn't impress me. The scrambles and omelets are way too heavy, with what seems like 3-4 eggs, tons of cheese, and a whole ton of grease. Not the way I like to start my day. Everything is oozing cheese and gravy and oil, but none of it really tastes like much. I always have to add black pepper and hot sauce, and it still often tastes like it could use more flavor. The food also in general seems like it's not fresh at all, either coming out of a box or a can and reheated or mixed in with eggs. Even the pancakes aren't that great...really huge but overly cake-y.  I probably won't come back, as there are so many really good breakfast and brunch options in Madison.",-1,-1
"So I love the food here.  I do.  I give it TWO full stars for food.  However, the other three they lose come from lack of service and organization.  You come in and wait in a hoard of persons vying for a table.  The line usually splits in two so it is the luck of the draw as to whether you get seated before the people who were five behind you in line.  It would be so simple (and probably quicker) to have someone directing people.  It is terrible enough that it loses three stars.  Perhaps that is not a breaking point for other people, but essentially stalking people while they eat is not my cup of tea.  The space in there is terrible.  You can not fit between tables, let alone in the winter with a coat on.  People bring strollers in to the restaurant creating blockages and tripping hazards.  None of this ok.  If you are going to have a diner as packed as the Dairy Bar, please prohibit strollers.  Callous?  Perhaps, a little.  However, it brings down your liability when someone will inevitably trip and fall.  The food is great.  Affordable, delicious and huge portions.  One portion is enough to feed two people (maybe three).  The food is hot and it is served quickly.  I was impressed that when I ordered scrambled eggs they came out fluffy.  In the restaurant business, eggs are generally the make or break point.  They are sometimes burned, some flat, sometimes just plain inedible.  Mickies is great when you want to grab a quick breakfast and just hang out for the day.  Avoid this place like the plague if you are there on the day of a football game.  It is a stone's throw from Camp Randall and as you can imagine packed with a sea of red.    Overall, Mickies is not to be missed.  However, leave everything but your wallet in the car.  And wear comfortable shoes because it is going to be a long wait.",-1,-1
"After being advised by my son to NOT eat at Mickey's, I thought, ""well, how bad could it be for breakfast?""  The answer: very bad.  This is a sleazy, greasy, dirty dinner frequented by people who are looking for only quantity because there is no quality.  The place, on a Thursday morning, was packed.    I ordered a cheese and bacon sandwich on toast.  The bacon had an ""off"" flavor.  I don't know if it was rancid, but the bacon was awful.  I was done after one bite.   My sister ordered French Toast which means ""bread dipped in an egg/milk wash and fried on a griddle.  When it came, it looked like well-done scrambled eggs; no discernible pieces of bread found.   The  ""mass"" covered the entire plate.  She said there was something wrong with the French toast; it had cinnamon and the bread was lumpy.  Then she tasted the raisin.  The waitress said this was ""Mickey's take on French toast.""  She should have said, ""This was yesterday's cinnamon raisin roll that was recycled for the poor souls who want french toast.""  After noting my sister was not happy with the cinnamon/raisin/egg much, she brought some regular toast as requested.    If you like a quality breakfast in a clean restaurant, this is NOT the place for you. A Waffle House is much, much better.  I should have listened to my son.  Never again will I pass though this dump.",-1,-1
"I would not let this guy work on a peddle car, much less an actual motor vehicle. Took my sons Infinity in for a steering problem. Not once but three times. Every time it was something else causing the problem. First it was the belts - replaced them. Second it was the steering rack because there was metal shavings in the fluid tank.- replaced power steering rack. Third time he replaced the power steering pump (actual cause) He may pull the wool on others, but I can tell you this guy could not diagnose a flat tire.",-1,-1
"Been taking cars there for years, so had no problem getting starter work done.  They never called to give me an update.  Had to rent a car, as I need to go to work.  So 5 days later, (kept calling but could not get through) drove over and found that the car was not finished, as the starter still did not work, and was told they ""might have to drop the transmission"" which would cost over $1K.  Charged me $600 for a starter that didn't work right.    Not saying the cost was wrong, as it may cost that much to fix it - however no call back in 5 days to let me know how it was going?  And does it really take over 5 days for a starter?",-1,-1
"Only talked to the mechanic and the guy at the front desk, the mechanic was VERY rude and the front desk took about a minute just to acknowledge my presence. I asked if they had time to look at my car, he just said no. He didn't even offer another time for me to come in. Prices may be cheap but I didn't even get a chance to see what they were cause the service was so horrible.",-1,-1
"I've always rooted for local businesses.  I just won't come back to this one.  I've been here for service at least 4 other times and had a reasonable experience.  Nothing bad to say.  Today is different.  I'm not going to go into detail about the countless times I tried calling with no answer.  I'll just say I had to go back to get the diagnosis 4 hours after dropping off my car only to find my car not on the property.  No big deal, probably out test driving it, right?  Well, no one knew where it went and couldn't find my paperwork.  20 minutes go by and finally someone brings it back and walks off.  Never comes over to address me, nothing.  Another 10 minutes go by, he finally comes back after being hunted down by another mechanic...tells me he doesn't know but he'll test drive it to pressurize it and check.  Uhhhh, what were you doing driving it then?!!  So, I leave it...another 3 hours go by...he calls back to tell me that the job is too extensive, I need a new radiator and he has too many cars and won't be open again till next Tuesday (today is Wednesday).  So, these guys wasted an ENTIRE day of going on joy rides instead of being upfront 8 hours ago.  Now, I'm in a time crunch going into Christmas weekend with NO CAR!!!  Never again!!!",-1,-1
"This hotel has no customer service at all!! No smiles,no nice greeting,and bad attitude at check in. (like they forced to be there) I called housekeeping as soon as we checked in because there was no remote in the room and the person that answered was rude and said ""remote?? Remote for what?? I was like for the TV?? Is there something else in the room that needs a remote???  Rooms are very old but loved their beds though (at least the one we had)  don't think I would stay there again",-1,-1
"We came in for lunch and sat at the area next to the bar. No one greeted us or told us where to sit when we came in. The bartender or server (some Asian guy with an attitude) who thinks he is cooler than us because he works at hooters, had an attitude taking our order. While waiting for our food he didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. We were thirsty as hell!! It's Vegas at 102 degrees outside. WE ARE THIRSTY!! So my husband had to hunt him down, as if he was busy. He only had 4 people in one party sitting at the bar. My husband got a couple of beers for us and before we even had a chance to finish our beers he came to our table and told us we need to pay now because it is time for him to go home! Seriously guy!! You should have gone home a long time ago with that stank attitude. Wings were ok, but the place has horrible customer service and it is very dirty and smelly! YUCK, never again.",-1,-1
Gross!! First of all I wasn't expecting much considering how cheap it was but wow this was by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. For starters the smell! Once I entered  the hotel I got the overwhelming smell of throw up. Am assuming someone threw up in the bar area which is right at the entrance.The hotel itself is very outdated the elevators look like something you would see in downtown L.A. I felt like I was going to get stuck a few times. The room was small and smelly the tub looked dirty and old. They charged a $16 resort fee and the wifi wasn't even working if I wasn't in a hurry the next morning I would demanded they way the resort fee. I don't recommend this hotel. I will not be staying here again.,-1,-1
.25cents wings & beef nachos! Bring it!!! Get your players card!  I gave this place 2 stars because the service wasnt good at all and the food was ok. I can microwave food too and serve it. Not a fan of the hotel. Kinda ghetto and the elevator is real slow.,-1,-1
"Cheap, pretty gross. The bathroom was dirty felt so uncomfortable showering, carpet in the room stained all over, curtains in the room also stained and over all I will not stay here ever again I rather stay at Motel 6 I'm sure they are way cleaner for a cheaper or same price to stay, staff are super nice though.",-1,-1
"Used Priceline express deal and got Hooters. The room, although ""updated"" and spacious, could not make up for the disgusting bathroom. The first room they gave us had a really dirty bathroom and they switched rooms for us with a less gross bathroom. First room also didn't have a shower curtain.  Only one elevator out of two for our tower worked, so it took forever to get to and from where you needed to go.  Casino is tiny.  Did not try the food. Will not be coming here again.",-1,-1
"Asian valet guy I think his name maybe be Michael was super rude! He totally harassed my friend and I for a tip (which we didn't have any cash on us). After getting inside of my vehicle the valet guy stood in front of my car window and asked me ""How was the service?"" l politely/Clearly told him ""Great, Thanks"" then he asked a second time and had some what of an attitude. I told him I had no cash on me (which is really none of his business) and for some reason he ended up telling us not to come back! Then I asked for him for his name (which I ended up getting from the front desk) and instead of telling me his name he walked away and started laughing. I understand wanting to be tipped but at the same time it's not a requirement to tip someone to do there job they get paid for . That honestly ruined my experience at this hotel and the room wasn't to great either.",-1,-1
"I went here with really low expectations and they somehow managed to fall short. Quite possibly the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. In a group of 9, three people sent their food back. Great ketchup, though. I would definitely come back to try the other 56 flavors.",-1,-1
This place is a dump. The rooms that are shown on line must be from when they initially opened. Not to mention the filthy carpets. No need telling anyone about this place. All they do is say they're sorry about it.,-1,-1
DO NOT EVER EVER EVER CONSIDER STAYING HERE! it's cheap but it needs to be closed down. One thing is saving money another is putting up with the worst when your trying to enjoy Vegas. I know you think I'll barely be in the room try taking a shower in s tub that's clogged & the water not being able to be adjusted things broken dirty smelly. Elevators hVd tagging no a/c in the hallways it's a DISASTER!! Circus circus is probably better then this and that's a Hot mess itself ! SHOP AROUND BALLYS FLAMINGO ETC .....,-1,-1
"I would say you get what you pay for but for a total of $160 for ONE night, this was a complete rip off. Room was a mess and there was a huge dead bug on the floor right when we walked in. This place needs some major work done. Would have been better off staying in a motel.   Never staying here again.",-1,-1
"The hotel was simply ""doable"" is the best way I can describe it. It's clearly old and really is no better than a motel. The staff was nice. I'm a pretty picky person and the bed was ""sleepable"" but we only stayed there for one night before driving to California so it did its duty but there's no way in hell I would book this hotel for an actual vacation.",-1,-1
"This location is good if you are on a budget, but don't expect anything better than the norm.  The decor is outdated and the food is just average.  Nothing special.  I had the 3 egg omelette and it was 'fine'.  Staff are friendly and accommodating with special requests - so they are the reason for my high rating.  I wont be back here, even just for laughs.",-1,-1
"EH... If it were on the strip it would be out of place. More along the lines of a Fremont Street.  Concerning the bar and restaurant on a Saturday night...slow bar service and oblivious bartenders. Wings were average, and certainly no comparison to our Chicagoland spots. Long waits for drinks, both at the bar and the table, were disheartening. Small hotel makes for a crowded lobby jammed with slots. For the price, it's possibly of value; however not what we look for in our Vegas Vacations...",-1,-1
"The receptionist's attitude was so rude. She didnt smile.The room is small,the bathroom is not clean. We have to pay 73$ per night. And they charged me 2 times for taxes and resort fee !!! so terrible!!! i will never come back !!!",-1,-1
"Everyone always things ""Oh hooters, great wings"" among other things (hehe). There wings are frickin' AWFUL! Breaded wings, I think you would be better off soaking a bunch of bread crumbs in wing sauce and call it a day. Our waitress acted like she was afraid of us and look I'm sure there are allot of disrespectful brutish men in the world that she has to deal with but my friends are super nice and she barely provided us with a poor excuse for service! Don't go here unless you just want to ogle women...seriously.",-1,-1
Lol what a dump.   This place seems like it is giving up and I most certainly wouldn't even eat here  Casino is so gross I'm not even sure I would stay in a comped room,-1,-1
"Never stay at Hooters. Room had bugs, dead TV, and air conditioner sounded like a B52 bomber.",-1,-1
"I've read a lot about this place that, ""You get what you pay for,"" but that doesn't mean that I should be inconvenienced multiple times because they don't know how to run a business.  Part of running a successful business would be to make sure their customers are happy even if it is at a more ""reasonable"" price, right?  Check-in was easy, but once I got to my room, it wasn't ready.  It looked pretty trashed and the maid was just starting to clean the room.  I could understand if I got there early, but their check-in time is 4:00 and I was there about 4:30-4:45.  I went back downstairs with all my luggage and waited a good 10 minutes to be waited on so I could tell the girl at the front desk that the room she gave me was not ready.  She at least upgraded me and waived 1-days worth of the resort fee, but she was pretty unapologetic, but I was okay with it.  So with that, here's a list of good/bad/what to look out for:  Good: -Inexpensive -Wild Onion (I think that's the name) is pretty good and so was the service. -Hooters Restaurant, my first time dining at one.  Wasn't too bad, but it's what I expected. -Pool is okay to just lay out and relax.  Not like one of the party pools, but I was there during the week. -Hooters girls at the restaurant and pool were friendly. -Bed was comfy and decorations are okay. -It was actually better than the Hilton (surprisingly a horrible hotel).  Bad: -A lot of broken things (like elevator buttons or the lights to know which elevator is on its way) -I paid a little extra for drink vouchers by the pool and $10 discount at Wild Onion.  They didn't give me the vouchers and when I asked for them they didn't ""see"" it on my reservation and wanted to see my confirmation.  I wasn't going to go upstairs AGAIN for it.  I got them after speaking with the manager, but again unapologetic and didn't really seem to care. -AC in room was crazy loud. -Bathroom wasn't that clean (hair still on the floor). -Sink was clogged and a horrible screeching sound from the shower that sounds like a tea kettle once the water is boiling. -Not enough people working in valet, so a lot of waiting around for them. -Casino is really small.  I think they're adding on to it. -Hotel front-desk staff are not so friendly. -Incredibly loud if you wind up with a room with a shared door!    Hopefully, once they're done remodeling (why they didn't do that when they opened?!) it'll be better.  But I came to find out I wasn't being picky.  During a conversation with other guests in the hotel, they noticed a lot of broken things and one said that the place is a POS and it's his first and last time staying there.    I might stay here again, but I think I'll save next time and stay at one of the nicer hotels/casinos.",-1,-1
Stayed here for a weekend.  Building is so run down.  Building has to be 50 years old.  Looks like they bought the building with old tvs and old furniture in it and slapped the Hooter logo on it. Was expecting the same experience I get when I have gone to their restaurants.  The AC in the room was so loud from the rattling all night.  We called rooms service for some late night food but after waiting 45 min I called and they told me they lost my order.  Staying at a motel 6 would have been better.,-1,-1
I was so disappointed to find out the 24 hour pool is gone. It was the only reason I ever stay here! I typically fly in late and relax by the pool. The past 2 years prior it was such an awesome way to kick off a week long trip. I wish I had some sort of warning or something. I would have stayed at a different hotel. It is nice that they want to upgrade the hotel but there were fumes everywhere and the casino itself is not great. It's losing any character that drew me there. You can update without loosing the essence of a place. Won't be back. :-( RIP 24/hr pool.,-1,-1
"Ordered delivery. Website says $3 delivery fee, they charged $8. Salad is very small, veggies are frozen, taste bad. Cucumbers with hummus: Cucumbers are also frozen. Very disappointed. Will not order from Bronze Cafe again.",-1,-1
"Ordered the The California Tofurky and was not impressed. First off the sandwich bread was all of 2 or 3 inches (just a bit bigger than bite size and not loaded with goods like I see here on Yelp), the Tofurky was a couple of extremely thin slices and greens were also minimal. The sandwiches have gotten much smaller than in the past. However I am impressed with your ability to slice an avocado that thin. N O T!   *Avo's also are in season now and very inexpensive.  Please stop penny pinching and give your customers some substance for their expenses.",-1,-1
"this place is just sad. It has nothing going on and  limited drink choices. It took an hour and half for our food to arrive and it was a joke. the gnocci were huge hard squares of potatoes, the jalapeño poppers were 3 large jalapeños too hot to actually eat... don't worry, our server warned us... AFTER we order and he had served them to us, and the grilled cheese bites were melted cheese on a hard crostini cracker. and it wasn't even cheap, it was quite expensive for what we got. sad.",-1,-1
"Recently came here for summerlicious ($25) last Friday night with some friends and when we arrived, the place was pretty much empty.. which is pretty alarming when you first try out a new restaurant.  Like some other restaurants in the area, this place does not offer a drinks menu. But you would have thought that you can just name a drink and they will make it for you. Wrong. The drink options are very limited and I ended up closing a local beer which was about $8.  The food was a hit and miss. Overall the portions were pretty generous, but the quality of food was very inconsistent, especially dessert. The Grilled cheese bites (appetizer) was the best of the 3 courses. The Pan fried crab cakes (main) was a bit burnt and covered with too much bread crumbs. The Coffee caramel creme brulee (dessert) was probably the worst, it pretty much just came out from the fridge- the entire dessert was still cold.  In terms of ambience, the interior could use some work. The place is very dull and dim. The patio would have been a big selling point, if they had set up the space for outdoor seating instead of it just being a smokers pit.   Service was not the best either. Our server who was also the bar tender could use a bit of a cheer me up. He lacked enthusiasm and a smile which I personally think is key for the food service industry. Who wants to see a Debby Downer when you are out to have a good time?",-1,-1
I ordered the fried chicken and after eating a couple bites from the outside realized it was still totally raw and *cold* in the middle.  Gross.,-1,-1
"Well, lets just say this is a super budget hotel in a ghetto area. Rooms are vintage and budget. Trash wasn't taken out outside and was overflowing everywhere onto the sidewalks around the entire building. Broken glass everywhere on driveways. If you're not familiar with Vegas, well, what can I say, stay away from this area. Had a couple guys come up to me while I was sitting in the car parking lot offering me drugs. Would not go back to this hotel ever again.",-1,-1
Just don't go it's really really bad. The rooms look way nicer in pictures than in reality. The first thing I saw when I arrived was a bed bug crawling around the least cushioned mattress in existence with no sheets or pillows just bed bugs.,-1,-1
"I've been calling for a couple hours now. Multiple times per hour, sometimes back to back for 10 mins straight and no one has picked up the phone. I would like to say this hotel has the worst customer service I've ever seen in my life. No one to pick up the phone for 5 hours (between 9 am - 1:45 pm?)? you've got to be joking! Honestly I would NOT recommend you stay at this hotel, book it online or anything at all! They make sure you pay 100% of the price of the room if you cancel too. BEWARE!!",-1,-1
"I'm upset that I have to give this business even 1 star. My bf and I had gone to eat arepas and seeing that this was the first time we ever saw this store open, decided to stop in. At first, the owner/mgr lady was great... friendly and helpful. Then, when I decided to make a purchase (of an item I'm sure I could find much cheaper online), things went south.   I purchased a yelp deal of 50 for 75 and the owner refused to honor it. She kept saying that yelp did not have a connection with her bank account and that yelp doesn't charge me- that my credit card information is only taken so that a redemption code is provided to me so I can receive the deal. Mind you, I've purchased yelp deals before and my card has MOST DEFINITELY been charged. I called my credit card company and had them verbally tell her that it was a purchase I already made and that my card was being charged by yelp. However, because the charge was in a pending status she still kept arguing that I was not being charged and that she would give me the 50 for 75 deal but I would have to pay the 50 to her, when I had already paid it to Yelp.  Also, throughout the whole time she kept pushing that I had to write a review to get any deal. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from this business now or ever again and have already contacted yelp about her refusal to honor the deal and getting my money back. I will give her one thing though, she got her review.",-1,-1
"Although the equipment ,classes and instructors are great It Is way TOO CROWDED  Some of their  classes are so crowded that it is dangerous.  To have that amount of people in one room there is bound to be an accident soon.   Even off hours the gym is packed  Forget going to a Pilates class there are only ten people allowed in the class and you have to come in half an hour before to get a number. If you do get in you are jammed in there like a sardine in a can.   I guess it's just about making money and not the client",-1,-1
I wouldn't recommend this club to anyone. The only person that I find genuine is Wendy.,-1,-1
"One of the bigger and I suspect more popular locations. The good news is that they have tonnes of cardio equipment. The bad news is that during prime iron-pumping time (i.e. after work), there's still a subway-line worthy crush of people to use the machines. There are plenty of classes, but I'll be what i am in workouts. A solitary man.   The gym itself is well-maintained and patrolled by hard-bodied trainers young and old, who aggressively push personal training services on you at every opportunity. Management supports this behaviour; they try to hook you up as soon as you sign on. I wouldn't mind checking in occasionally to ensure proper form, or introduce new exercises, but I don't need or want a drill sergeant hovering over me while I struggle through my last set of chest flies.   Change rooms on the other hand, a cramped, overheated and dark. A single bathroom is always dirty, and the showers scare me a little.   Goodlife is all smiles and customer service when you sign your contract, but murderous when you try to end it. It took me two months (non-refunded) to cancel at the end of my year there. For that reason alone, I won't be going back,",-1,-1
"The staff are friendly, but the facility is overcrowded and not particularly well-maintained. It's disappointing to see that a gym that with so many members and so little space, would reserve 25% percent of it's area to personal trainers.",-1,-1
"Facility is great but the fitness manager cannot do her job. Bought personal training sessions at the beginning of feb 2010 and have yet to get the service, it's now July! She is also unapologetic for how badly she does her job and how she treats people.",-1,-1
"Don't let the name fool you. This place is bad. A bizarre use of space and a bunch of machines whose sole purpose is to work the parts of your legs next to your junk make this gym inconvenient and frustrating. Trying to go after work? Don't even bother. Go to a bar. You'll get more out of it. It really is a shame that this and Extreme are the only girls in the room. Yonge and St. Clair could really use some smoking hot piece with personality and enough courtesy to not take all your money and ask for a thank you afterwards. Goodlife, you get 2 stars only because you're close and Food Network is on the TV sometimes.",-1,-1
"Not the best layout. Traffic moving in every direction. The equipment is not organized in any logical way. Equipment/attachments are not returned to their rightful place or are missing entirely. The mirrors make the space very confusing and makes you feel like you are walking around drunk. The men's change area is a maze of small rooms, awkward corners, dead ends and low ceilings. The lockers are all half size and there is little room to undress/dress, especially if you are coming straight from work and have an extra bag/runners, etc. My biggest problem with this location is the layout. It's difficult to have a smooth, uninterrupted workout given the condition of the facilities.",-1,-1
"Was hoping for a good slice and was majorly disappointed. Too thick, too soggy and flavor  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT",-1,-1
"Way, way, way, WAYYYYyy too expensive! $15 for a large cheese pizza? Out of control prices.  $1.75 - $2.00 for each additional pizza item! Really? This is a new high.    With 4,000 other pizza shops in the area, you had better get more competitive.",-1,-1
"The food is good at best however they recently increased their prices and made the portions smaller, I used be able to leave there paying 5 dollars for a big salad, pizza that covered the plate and a pop. Now you get a very small bowl of lettuce, small slice of pizza and a pop for 6 dollars. I like the food but probably will not return due to the prices, not a good value.",-1,-1
My girlfriend ordered a calzone and it was not fully cooked. The dough on the outside was golden brown but the inside was not cooked at all. She took it back and they would not give her money back only offered a store credit.,-1,-1
Paid 20 bucks for 10 small breaded mushrooms and 20 boneless wing nuggets. Really? Does that come with a reach around too?,-1,-1
I had the chicken parm with spaghetti and some meatballs. It smelled and tasted like a wet sock!  This was last chance I will give them. Heck I even went to pick up my food and the people working there were dirty then the food!  2 thumbs down,-1,-1
The pizza here is sometimes hit-or-miss. Over the last two times I've ordered pizza from this place it's been a Miss. The reason it's been a mess is not only when you get the pizza home the crust is soggy and oil drenched but it literally I've never had a pizza that I just simply couldn't eat reheated because of the sloppy mess it turned into. No I'm not sure if they made a change to their sauce in fact our pizza was a cheese only Pizza and thereby should have had no or little grease from any sort of meat like pepperoni or sausage. But the crust was exceptionally thin and floppy and it may have been a doe issue after all because it seems like the dough was allowed to rise properly. I enjoy a nice slice unfortunately the last couple pizzas I bought there really didn't seem worth the trip or the trouble to go out and pick one up.,-1,-1
"If the location weren't convenient I wouldn't stop here. It just should not be a 15+ minute wait for any drink, particularly my Americano.  And on a busy work morning expect another 15+ minute wait in line! Topped with mostly unpleasant and sometimes blatantly rude employees, Corporate needs to pay this store a visit and get it up to standards. On the positive side, when you finally do get your coffee, there's a pleasant outdoor seating area.",-1,-1
"I have been coming into this Starbucks lately because it's convenient.  Cathleen is usually the barista. It's really an unpleasant visit, due to the fact I don't like hearing negative gossip. She is always complaining about being tired etc... I made a mistake on my order, I apologized and asked her if she could fix it. She said nothing just gave me the angry maybe look and said it will be .60 cents more for the changing milks. I said ok no problem.  I never get treated at Starbucks like that or anywhere.  Maybe they should teach a class there on body language and guest service.",-1,-1
"Consistently poor customer service every single time I am here. Starbucks CEO offering a free cup of coffee for all those that pay it forward to someone else during the government shutdown... ""Nope, we're not doing that here."" Nice. Where's a Dutch Bros when you need it?",-1,-1
"This is the worst Starbucks in the area. Let me help you out:  1) If you go here to study, take a jacket because it's FREEZING  2) Their iced coffee is really weak most of the time  3) Consistently the longest wait, even for the most simple drinks. I've been late to work so many times because it takes them forever. Definitely go to a different location if you can 4) There was a point where I went here a couple times in a row and every single time they totally messed up my drink. How hard is it to make a sweetened iced coffee?",-1,-1
I have mixed feelings about the service here sometimes good sometimes poor and you are just ignored but I went in yesterday to pick up a mobile order and ducked into the restroom and to my horror please see attached shots I would expect this in a Gilda bend circle k. But not a Scottsdale Starbucks.,-1,-1
"Slowest Starbucks I have ever visited!  They had two people working cash registers and one working food items and only one barista. Obviously, that lone barista got behind....WAAY behind! Unfortunately, even the two cashiers got behind!    Typical good Starbucks products and great location.  But, I'm sure they lose customers because of the wait for service.",-1,-1
"1st attempt at using Starbucks online ordering app. #fail Order, supposed to pick up at counter 5-6min later. Arrive 9 min later, order still on printer, store not busy. *sad trombone sound*",-1,-1
"can't say I like this Starbucks. Workers see evil morning people. Seems like if I makes changes to my drinks like add extra pump of classic syrup, barista's get grouchy. No bueno.",-1,-1
"I was here Sunday morning ordering 2 drinks, both frappuccinos. The cashier proceeded to say how she ""hates frappaccinos"" and she couldn't find the button on the screen to select a certain one and therefore blamed the manager for not adding it. The young man making the drinks was just as clueless and instead of trying to help her AND us they started talking about gangster rap and what kind of music they listen too. It took me 7 minutes to order my drink and another 10 to receive them both. These two were incredibly slow and not paying attention to the customer, just stopping what they're doing to talk about rap music. Needless to say that was my first and last experience at the Starbucks. Poor service all the way around.",-1,-1
"Populated by a surly staff who, due to the neighborhood, start from the assumption that everyone in the store is a criminal, it at least has a larger selection than the one on Trop @ Pecos.",-1,-1
"The cosmetics section now has a register right outside. You're not supposed to take a cart in and you have to pay for what you purchase right there. I know it's probably something to do with cutting down on theft, but it makes buying things a big hassle, especially when I have my little kids in tow. So now I buy my makeup on Amazon or I go to Target.   There are many, many things I dislike about this location. There's always trash in the parking lots or in the carts, things are constantly out of stock, things are constantly misplaced, and it's a gamble if your cashier will be friendly or rude and silent. I've had a couple cashiers who were friendly and pleasant to talk to, but more often than not, they seem like they hate everything. I get it, it's not a fun job, I was a Walmart cashier 10 years ago. But even in my angsty teenage years, I could manage a ""hello"" and a friendly smile to customers in my line. Most of them don't bother with a greeting.  I will say, however, that when I do a price match (usually on meat or produce), it's gone smoothly (so far). One time a cashier even asked if I was done with the flyer I'd brought in and if she could use it to get her own discounted chicken. I told her to stock up; it was a great price. :)",-1,-1
"You are here Well I must say this location never disappoints if you feel the need to be entertained.  This is my oh my gosh I forgot X store, it is open 24 hours and if you want a real trashy treat go in here after dark (around midnight is pretty good too) I love to people watch and this place has some interesting people. French fry's at McDonald's will give you a front row seat to all the madness at the registers. I have seen school age children roaming the isles with their parents at 2am! Half dressed people, shoe less people, and drunk disorderly people, it is a great place to watch humanity in all it's glory.  The registers are far to few, even when they are open (they are never all open), so you will be waiting in line, and don't try to buy beer or wine in a line where the cashier is under 21.. uugghhhh it's Vegas people get it together.   You had better not need electronics, separate register for that, god forbid you have more items to purchase..  Watch your purse, wallet, cell phone, this place is shady acres, just sayin..",-1,-1
"If I could give it a negative star that would work for me. Third time in two weeks garden center door not open. All I wanted was xmas lights all times. Tonite there was a woman who struggled to get out of her car, go to garden center door only to have it locked. Took her five minutes to walk 100 feet back to her car to try to find another ADA spot. A few months ago a gal was stealing bagged food by combining bags. I mentioned it to security. No action taken. No wonder why so much retail is lost at this store. Yes Walmart you have taken over the market. Have you taken over my heart - absolutely not!!",-1,-1
"From rude employees to even ruder managers.  My husband bought me a pair of pants hair.  I tried them on and they didn't fit.  Took them back in a day later.  They said they couldn't take them back because they have been worn.  Yeah for like 2 minutes.  Asked to talk to a manager he was even ruder.  He said that was the stores policy.  I called the Walmart customer service and they called the manager and told him to exchange it.  He told them OK he would then he got off the phone and still told me know.  He said I can call customer service as many times as I want but that they will do what they want to do.  Don't even try to get help in this store electronics department is a joke and nobody is ever working in it.  Or you get the notorious finger up in the air when you go towards an ""associate"" to get help.",-1,-1
"OMG.  A Vegas Walmart.  Do Not Want.   In a modern interpretation this would be one of Dante's nine circles of hell.    They should just hand out packs of condoms to everyone who enters this place, and if they ask why, shove a mirror in their face.      Go to Target, spare yourself.",-1,-1
"I had to shop at this Wal Mart after a show at Sams Town which is across the street. I was in Vegas on vacation and needed water, juice, milk, etc.. It was after 10 PM.  This is one creepy place.  Even though the parking lot is well lit, as were some people, there were just too many undesirable ""patrons"" hanging near and around the entrance.  I couldn't tell if they were employees on break or locals using this as a community center, but I did not feel at all comfortable and I don't scare easily.  I feel safer in the subway in New York! I made it through the store and back to my car without myself or my car being damaged.  I'll stick with Target.",-1,-1
"Had a flat tire, waited three hours. Less than a month later, it happened again: THEY PUT A NEW TIRE ON A CRACKED RIM! I didn't receive an apology, because apparently I should know how to do their job. I called to speak with a manager, the store manager, who NEVER returned my call.    I ended up spending another three hours and $500 at a different tire place because these people were so far off the mark: both front rims were damaged and not one ""mechanic"" checked, which I'm told is SUPPOSED to be standard procedure.   No apology, no discount, no more money wasted at Walmart!",-1,-1
Typical wal mart: hood  At least at this location the employees actually stop you to check your receipt.,-1,-1

"please check your receipt, walmart does not always process your coupons especially if they are over a 1.00, this has happened to me three times, along with stocking during he day 11:00 am, and they act like the aisle is theirs heaven forbid you ask them to let you by they act like you shouldn't be there. walmart also price matches, but that depends on which line you get in some clerks are really good and some clerks are really bad.",-1,-1
"THIS IS NOT THE PLACE YOU WANT TO SHOP IN THE EARLY MORNING! I purchased an item for someone's child yesterday that was too small. I came in this morning with a male friend to make a return. We arrived at the customer service center and I noticed that the lights were off. There was an older woman ahead of us and we stood there until they opened in a few minutes. My male friend and I were talking and joking, nudging each other and when he put his arm around my shoulders, the MANAGER yells in front of other customers and employees ""HEY! YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE THAT OUTSIDE!"" First of all, what EXACTLY do I need to take ""outside""? We were not kissing nor touching inappropriately in any way, just merely sharing a joke among each other. Secondly ,if she felt like what we were doing was in any way inappropriate, as a grown woman, leader, and professional , she could have come up to me and expressed her concerns and opinions in a low manner as to not cause a disturbance in the store. It took ALOT for me to not give her a piece of my mind or anything else she should receive. I felt disrespected and racially profiled. When I stopped to ask another manager in another department what her name was, she provided it and immediately said ""Did she say something rude to you?"" Which lets me KNOW that Evelyn has had other occurances of rude behavior. This can and will not be tolerated. As human beings in a rough and very unpredictable society, there should and could be other ways to handle this.  I will be calling cooperate to report her and will return tonight after work to speak to the general manager and make my return like I was supposed to do to begin with! WALMART NEEDS TO PROVIDE EVELYN SOME MORAL AND LEADER TRAINING BEFORE SOMEONE WITH A WORSE TEMPER GETS AHOLD OF HER! COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL EVELYN! SERIOUSLY!",-1,-1
"Although I don't find it as ""ghetto"" as other reviewers it is not the best.  I actually used to shop at the now closed Walmart on N Nellis and LV Blvd and found that they always had the item I was looking for. This store on Boulder Hwy seems to not carry simple items such as bean sprouts and spicy chili no beans!  There is a lot of police action each time I shop at this store. Not my favorite but not as bad as some folks think.",-1,-1
"Yes, this Walmart is totally ghetto. It's embarrassing these employees call themselves Walmart employees. This Walmart location looks like a disaster. The parking lot is filled with trash. There is trash inside the Walmart. There are return carts everywhere. I feel like no one is maintaining this Walmart.  Looking for Customer service? Don't look for it at this location, there is none here. Donna in customer service is a useless employee that in my opinion, should be retrained on how to be of assistance to customers. I tried to return something because the price dropped in it and she lied saying I couldn't return. Her excuse to why I couldn't return it: well that's why we drop the prices, so you can't return it. I can't forget the attitude she gave me when she said it. Donna, get your manager because I bought something 2 days ago, it's unopened, not final sale items and WITHIN the Walmart return policy. This is the worst Walmart EVER and Donna is probably one of the worst Walmart employee ever. Oh and Guess what Donna? I went to another Walmart and returned it with no issues/questions. I don't know how an attitude-giving employee can work in customer service, let alone at a so-called great company named ""Walmart"".",-1,-1
"As you have read in other comments, this is not a Walmart flagship style store. Patrons vary from Bentley Owner to guy pushing 3 guys on a moped. I agree with another Yelper that said this is a great place to people watch. I work nights so when I am off I am awake over night so I have been to this walmart quit a bit. I was trying to do some work around the house last night and needed some spray paint. I went to this walmart. After waiting 20 min after they called for a person to help me in paint, I was told by an employee that I will never get spray paint due to it being after 10pm and that it is illegal in Clark County to sell it to me after 9pm, she backed this comment up by pointing to a sign on the case that said ""if you find this case unlocked please find an worker to lock it. she got extremely loud with me and was letting me know over and over I would not get any. After talking to with ( i think her name was Alisa) the manager (who was very nice and helpful) I got my paint. Non the less if you are not ready for the ghetto, don't come here after 6pm, go to the one on Marks st in Henderson, 3 miles away and everything is not under lock and key.",-1,-1
"What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip, turned into an hour of my life wasted.  I'm not a fan of Walmart but sometimes they have what I'm looking for. On one of my trips into Wally World, I was in a rush to grab a gift for my friend's daughter. Long story short, after talking to about 10 teenaged employees who didnt care or know what to do in order to get the education shelves unlocked, an elder gentleman finally came through with the help I needed.  Sounds like China needs to invest in some customer service training!",-1,-1
"The lady behind the register at the tire center was very kind and professional, but as for the manager, didn't get his name, older guy with long grey hair, was very rude! He does not know how to speak to customers and should be replaced with someone who understands the meaning of management/customer service. He was very upset that he had to adjust what they tried to charge me, knowing they were in the wrong. I should have been the one upset.",-1,-1
"NEVER GO HERE.  Wal-mart is wal-mart, some are bigger some are smaller. The problem with this one is the lines. Most of the time the lines are a big long, no big deal, you wait an extra 5 minutes ( so normal check out is around 8 to 10 minutes total). However at least 4 times this year the wife and I have waited over 45 minutes to check out. One time, we just left out stuff in the cart and walked out after waiting an hour in line.    The only tips I can give you:  Never go during the first of the month. Get there before like 7am - after that you are waiting Watch out over half the checker can touch alcohol - which slows things down.",-1,-1
Bad service..i can only speak for the photo department. I usually do print 11x14 and up. They always delay me. When i finally go pick up the print. It has ink spill so i have to wait again to print another 20mn.  Come on seriusly can the people that work on this department check the print before the give it to the customer!  And this is also true for the photo dept at nellis and steward!  I guess the people that work here need to be train better to resolve printer and system issues. And not to wait for the (technician) for a day just to do something simple as changing the ink.   By the way  im writing this review as im wating for a 16x20 re-print that they or the machine mess up.,-1,-1
everything is poor in this Wal-Mart no one helps you and they tell you to go talk to someone just to go and find one item.... I'm fur sure never coming back to this one ever again not to  mention  that the area is terrible!,-1,-1
"ON Tuesday night around 6:30 pm I went to have a key made in the service dept. , The associate that was I guess closing that department, asked if I need out , I said no I needed a key made and she responded rudely that it was closed!  Would have been nice to know there was a key machine at the front of the store but obviously she didn't share that information.  I will not be visiting that store again nor will my family!   Holidays or not  you really need to refocus and be nice to the customers, without customers you don't have a job or a  pay check and if that's all your there for is the paycheck then you probably shouldn't be around customers with that attitude.",-1,-1
Worst experience ever at the bakery! Rude and condescending employees. Manager Paul isn't any better.,-1,-1
"So I called Walmart and was immediately answered by someone. I asked to talk to someone in automotive and was told it would be just one minute. I waited 10 minutes then hung up after no one picked up. Also just a side note, I didn't here any ""hold music"" or anything. Nobody ever picked up during those ten minutes. It would've been a simple question about the availability of some tires I was interested in.",-1,-1
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!   There's been other walmarts that are worse than this (trop and pecos-no longer there).   Its an o....k store I guess,-1,-1
"Walmart is Walmart...I really don't expect much from this place. Yes I can find a lot of items I might want or need at a decent price, but my main problem are their staff. Everytime I go into this specific one the employees seem not to care about anyone. I must say some of the elderly people are very nice. Today I was waiting to be rung up and the cashier stepped away for a couple minutes, but the time he decided to come back my way he rolled his eyes. I'm concerned with the many useless, rude employees a lot of companies have on their payroll.",-1,-1
"Slow, brainless staff - the simplest task will take 30 minutes. Never coming back here again ugh",-1,-1
"I hate to even give 1 but when it's what's in the area and you can't stick to the prices you post vs when you ring the item up its a SCAM.  It's Walmart so you can't expect anything BUT this is beyond pathetic.  No competency at all, you could run this place by monkeys and it'd be better. Not to mention when I notice your scamming the price and you pull me out of line because you don't want to price check and you want me to do the work why would I bother?!? NO ONE SHOULD GO HERE.  Not to mention its ""ghetto"", unsanitary, and scary perverse people!",-1,-1
"food shelves always empty,  or there are times you go to buy eggs, and find a pair of men's underwear on top of the eggs.  everywhere in the food area , you find clothing or half eaten food. many check out lanes, but always only two open.  People fighting, screaming  kids, drunks in the bathroom having there morning shower.   pan handlers always out front of store, shopping carts everywhere, when you return to your car you have to gather up all the carts so that you can drive out of the parking lot.  I don;t know how this store can stay open!",-1,-1
"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I don't even want to give them any stars! They lack customer service, even the managers/loss prevention are unprofessional, and the store is always dirty. Walmart has gone downhill and it shows. The fact that I have to have my receipt checked at the door speaks volumes about the kind of crowd this place attracts. Never coming back.",-1,-1
"This WalMart, like all others, is completely and utterly worthless.  What money you may save you waste waiting in the hours you spend in the check out line.  At least it was a clean store - not really.  This place would score a D+ in a health rating.  Finally, as I spend however many minutes it took to walk to their electronics section, listening in the overhead speaker about how is going to close at seven. I get there, finally only to have a human chain of people telling me that the electronics is closed and that I can't get the Christmas gift I need to give! Thanks Walmart you truly are the lowest common denominator.",-1,-1
Morons work here. They are too rude and will leave you waiting at the register until they're ready. Go to Walgreens for all your health products.,-1,-1
"This place deserves no stars! Went with my husband around 6pm, about 10 people there sitting at the bar & playing pool. Well lit & clean but no one working there even acknowledged us, after sitting at a table for approx. 8 minutes. That's when my husband went to the counter to place a food order & was told they don't have real Coke, they have ""bar""/fake Coke. And that's when we left.  Major disappointment. Lookout Silver Swan on Front St., here we come!",-1,-1
"Not really a bad place to go on half-price burger night, which is either Tuesday or Wednesday.  They serve cheap pitchers of beer every night.   I wouldn't tell you to stay away, because it's very cheap and the service was pretty friendly.   But be aware this is a dive, although not quite as divey as it looks from the outside.  They have a pool table and the when we were there a guy was smoking the whole time he was playing.  So the Health Code is apparently not a big priority.    For a cheap bar/restaurant in the Falls, try River City Grill or Jimmy Biggs.",-1,-1
I bought window tinting for my husband several years ago and it was fine so we bought a bed cover from them last year they installed it and it started falling apart we asked them before the year warranty was up and they told us it was our issue to go to the company who sold it to them. We called the company they said no quality bumper is responsible for the install we called QB again they still won't help us so now we have a truck bed cover that is falling apart cant protect our tools etc...this was almost 2000k this company does not back their work,-1,-1
"I called today sept 1 2015 just to get a quote on an install of a cover for a truck. Was given a price,and asked how much including tax. .The man uttered "" F***ing guy"" under his breath. Now I don't know about you guys but that is not good customer service, since when is cursing at a client a good idea? Well needless to say I will be giving my money to an establishment that is courteous. Too bad to because I just bought the truck and am planning on dropping a big chunk of money in it.",-1,-1
"Update: We were finally and thankfully able to get the owner/manager of Quality Bumper, Todd Delabio, down to the Chevy dealership who first inspected the water leak. So much easier dealing with everyone at once at a neutral location rather than the nightmare and a half that was constant back and forth calling and arguing just to get someone to understand that hey...something is wrong with our car that wasn't there before the hitch was installed. Quality Bumper was telling us one thing and the dealership was telling us another all while being stuck in the middle and told we were being bullies for our reviews. It was depressing, exhausting to the point of wanting to give up,  we were getting thrown in so many directions and no one was owning up. It was a giant mess that I'm happy is finally past us once we were able to get all hands on deck. Todd was very pleasant in person and understanding that we would rather have the dealer handle our car from here on out, he definitely worked with us to figure out that at some point during the hitch installation a medium size filter looking thing with flaps that keeps water out had fallen off and was never noticed or put back on. Eureka! Unfortunately snapping it back into place required the bumper coming off but Todd offered to foot the bill and for that I am thankful to Quality Bumper. Will hopefully be setting up an appointment with Todd soon to get our car detailed and that moldy water smell out of the carpets. In the end we're very happy Todd/Quality Bumper and Chevy were willing to work with us to figure all this out.",-1,-1
"My review of this place is a little late due to waiting for my tint to properly cure and also working with the Manager, Dennis on some challenges with tinting installation.   So, my origional appointment was on Saturday January, 28th. I purchased a Groupon for $40 equating to  $100 credit towards window tinting.  The people here are friendly, clean place and initial customer service was good.   When you arrive, the person who works with you gives you 3 options of tint quality that you can purchase and use your $100 Groupon credit towards. This may not be exact but, the prices are as follows:   Cheapest Quality tint: $150 Medium Quality tint: $324 Best Quality tint: $424  Of course, these prices are without taking off the $100 Groupon credit and may also reflect that I have an Infiniti SUV.  The Groupon does not state that there is an extra charge for SUV'S or trucks either. There is an additional unknown charge for tint removal.  To make this brief, I fealt that the quality of installation was 3 out of 5 stars and the challenge resolution has been 2 out of 5 stars so far. Once I get things squared away, I will write a follow up review....stay tuned...",-1,-1
"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had.   NEVER GO HERE   I ordered an overpriced ravioli dish ($18 for 5 raviolis). It took them 25 min to serve me my dish and I was literally the only person at the restaurant at noon on a saturday. The pasta was WAY overcooked and barely edible.  There was a guy shouting on his cell phone, walking around the restaurant. He seems to have worked there. It was really annoying.",-1,-1
"It's not just a buffet, regrettably. We had a coupon and went there midweek at 5pm; I anticipated that would be a time when it wouldn't be busy and I was correct, but that didn't help at all. The decor is pretty standard ""Sheraton chic""; verging on tacky, but just managing to avoid it. The apps came promptly and were the very best part of the meal; my charcuterie board was actually very nice. Too bad the platter it came on was bigger than our table, literally. It looked like a visual, food-based representation of canada...a lot of land, and not many people. My wife had to rest her shrimp on it.   25 minutes [yes, 25 minutes] after the waiter removed our appetizers my wife got tired of waiting for the mains and went to find the washroom. I'm guessing the [new] waiter was hiding around the corner in anticipation, because the second she disappeared our steaks arrived. Turns out the washrooms are for the entire hotel and you need to change buses to get to them. By the time she got back about ten minutes later, our food was stone cold [although it had only been lukewarm when it arrived], but we dreaded the thought of asking for new plates and waiting for who knows how long. So we had cold steak and instant mashed potatoes you could use to apply wallpaper.   45 minutes [yes, 45 minutes] after they removed our mains, the desserts arrived. Typical Sysco stuff, not surprisingly.   There was one source of entertainment that was ongoing during this excruciating experience, however. We amused ourselves by watching a solitary guest send his meal back three times. He was livid! Ironically, he arrived after us and still made it out before we did.   The problem with the service appeared to be that our waiter had two other people ""helping"" him. They were all equipped with remote mics but I don't think they spoke the same language; the lack of communication was astonishing.   At the end, we got the bill three times from three different people, and guess what? Each and every bill was exactly the same as the other ones, and none of them took the coupon into account.   The two ""helpers"" were astonished to hear that we had a coupon, since the first waiter had taken it away at the start of the meal and they both asked us to produce it... that's when I almost lost it, but my wife restrained me. I guess they thought we were lying? Our original waiter then arrived with the third bill, informing us that we paid full price now and the discount would be taken off the final bill when we checked out of the hotel. When we politely pointed out we weren't staying at the hotel, he didn't know what to do.   After more than two  and a half hours in ""The Twilight Zone"", it took us a few minutes to get accustomed to the natural light out in the parking lot.    Quite possibly the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and that's saying a lot.",-1,-1
Had a 'light dinner' special.  Spetzel (sp?) was tasteless.  Turkey club was ok.  Sweet potato fries were pretty good.,-1,-1
Used to be ok...pizza was over cooked...bread sticks not good tried giving to the dog but just looked at me. Over all last time I order there. We had to go out to eat because it was just that bad.,-1,-1

"We are done with Bruno's! I was just accused of trying to get a free pizza! Their food has went so far down hill, and the owner is a jerk! Our pizza had such a scant amount of cheese the toppings couldn't stay on. I politely called to tell them this and the owner yelled at me and said I was trying to get s free pizza. We spend plenty of money there and tip  much more than necessary. Also the lettuce in our salad was brown and the onions were translucent with age. There wings are the worst I've ever had and their ravioli are canned sauce over Costco frozen ravioli. Straighten up Bruno's!",-1,-1
Bruno is a liar! He messed up my order and delivery driver spent close to an hour and a half trying to find my place then I called and complained and not just once but 4 times. Do not come here.,-1,-1
"We have been coming here for years and there food is taking a turn for the wort. There pizza is good, but terrible reheated. There wings are the worst I've ever had. Way over cooked and little flavor. You can't eat inside and have a beer because the owner keeps the air off. I called to complain and they didn't even care to rectify the situation. No more Bruno's for the Abril family.",-1,-1
"This is a followup to my 1/2 post.  We have been going here for a couple of years for Monday burger night (3 times in last 6 weeks).  This night of 1/2 was not really out of the ordinary.  Waitress seemed to favor bigger table and not overly friendly.  Happy hour ends at 6pm and we were there (2 of us) at 5:30 and the other 2 at 5:45pm.  Ordered food on split ticket at 5:50pm and got it at 6:40.  Had to flag waitress down to get another round of drinks, since she was preoccupied by bigger groups.  They charge for anything extra on the burger.  OK, bacon and cheese I understand - no problem.  They charge extra for mayonnaise of $.50.  I have been there 3 times in past month or so and EVERYtime the bill is wrong.  Sometimes in your favor, sometimes not.  This time I don't know.  The drink specials weren't posted, so I don't know what I really paid.  Food was undercharged.  Last time the drinks were overcharged.  3 of 4 ordered burgers medium.  All were well done !!  NOT pink at all, not even close.  Too bad.  The food is ok, but burgers are always well done.  Service is suspect at best and look at your bill.  We have always had a wrong amount.   Wait staff usually blame the owner.  Oh well.  We swore this is our last time there.  50 minutes to get a burger is ridiculous.  Maybe they need more staff?  It's a bar, we usually tip well if we are served quickly and correctly.  15% is my minimum and usually 20+%, even on alcohol.",-1,-1
"Worst food and worst service I've had here in 4 years. Cold Fries, no mayo, had to wait for beer until food was half gone. Used to love this place, now it will be a long time till we return. Waitress sent Mgr over to talk to us. Mgr said she would have comped both meals if we hadn't posted negative reviews on social media. She did comp us one meal.",-1,-1
Lousy service.  Waitress crabby.  45 minutes to get food.  Don't see waitress.  Had to flag her down to get drinks or food.,-1,-1
"Typical neighborhood bar, nothing noteworthy to bring you back. Service at the bar ranges from acceptable to nonexistent - that's why my wife and I walked out after one round yesterday - we couldn't get waited on to order a second. Too many better places to go to ever come back to Simpletons.",-1,-1
"Typical dive bar. I noticed if you're not a ""regular"" there then they won't look your way. They're simply there to collect a paycheck and whatever tips they can get, which even then they have no sense of urgency.   They are all over the place and because of their unorganization, they forget you've been standing there waiting to order a drink.   The food is so-so, nothing special, though fairly priced. If you go solely for Karaoke on Saturday nights expect to sing 1-2 songs, 3 if you're lucky. The rotation is too long to work it's way back around.   I ordered a beer on tap, the glass smelled of Clorox Bleach and tasted old. Made me feel sick to my stomach. They need to call 'Bar Rescue' or something.  When it comes to mixed drinks they are overpowering. For alcoholics this may not seem like an issue, but for those who are social, occasional drinkers who want a  nice, fruity tasteful drink..forget about it. They guesstimate the outpouring. The decor is ""weird"" to say the least. Old Westerny Theme could sum it up. It's DEFINITELY NOT for the Younger scene.   If you're looking to play darts, don't waste your time. The darts don't stick and are broken. Pathetic. They just take up room. I'm not being rude, or exaggerating my review in any way. Just giving my dead-honest perception and opinion.",-1,-1
They charge for you to be there for karaoke as if you're paying to see a band!! Hellloooo nobody cares about karaoke!! Service was ok... Except maybe the relieving bartender should lay off the drugs before coming to work,-1,-1
"Deal was $10.00 fish and chips on the front of the menu.  All the fish you can eat and it came with a French fries.  The menu also stated soup or salad and they didn't change the menu saying they don't offer that deal anymore and would not honor it.  Poor policy since we asked about it, won't go back now.  Plus fish needs some seasoning but still tasted good.",-1,-1
"Ok, I stopped in with 2 friends last night.  I went up to the bar and ordered a pitcher of Shock Top beer.  I didn't get the bartender's name - she was thin and looked to be in late 40s or early 50s.  She wasn't real friendly but that wasn't a big deal.  I handed her a 20 and figured the pitcher of beer would be about $9-12.  This is a small bar in a strip mall in mesa, what most would consider a dive bar.  Anyway, she give me back $4.5 in change.  I tipped an additional $2 and did not get a thank you....so my pitcher of beer cost $15.5 in a dive bar in Mesa.  I finally went back up to the bar and asked if the price was correct.  She said that, yes, it is a premium pitcher and cost $15.50.  Needless to say, this is outrageous pricing and we will not be returning.",-1,-1
"Come here because the GF loves karaoke, service is always pretty sub-par. Tonight, waitress messed up our drink order, not a big deal, but when I told her the order was wrong she just shrugged her shoulders at me. I assumed she was going to bring me the drink I ordered, I was wrong. Place is a joke.",-1,-1
"We were invited here by some friends on Saturday night to celebrate another friend's birthday.  It's been a couple years since my last visit to Simpleton's but one thing that I remember was their burgers and fries.  In fact, a couple of us have since referred to the burgers as ""BABs"" (big a** burgers).   That's the first thing we ordered and I wasn't disappointed.  The burgers are big, juicy and tasty.  The large portion of fries on the side hit the spot too.  I'd say that Simpleton's lives up to its name.  It's a small bar, not too fancy and no frills but the food I've tried is good and priced right.  If you're thirsting for draft beer, they have domestic pitchers for just $7.   However, if you're looking for a bar that mixes quality specialty drink or shots, this probably isn't your place.  We ordered ""Washington Apples"" - they ended up being really watery and overpriced.  I'd go back for a BAB though!",-1,-1
Hello all... Saw a show about this place on a food network.. It was giving rave reviews.... $30 beer pitcher was not cold. The chicken was suppose to be the best in Vegas..... It ranks as one of the worst tasting  most expensive( $70 for 24 pieces)chicken I've had. Will never return. They also charge a premium tax for live entertainment. When I asked where the live music was they said they were streaming it... There for the tax............ Going to Popeyes for a decent meal!!,-1,-1
"I only got as far as the lobby, and never made it upstairs. The ""bouncer"" located in the front was rude, thinking he could speak to me like this was Brooklyn! He had another thing coming (I can assure you I was not intoxicated nor belligerent.) This was my first time at this establishment and it put a bad taste in my mouth. As the expression goes, ""first impressions are everything!"" I don't feel like revisting Brooklyn Bowl again. I don't think it will be much of a lost in my life. And for that reason, I will not be recommending them to anyone I know!",-1,-1
"The Groupon deal is what got me in the door. Three silver washes for $24.00. The deal was a steal and not to far from my home which intrigued me to give them a try.   The location is right in the Paradise Valley Mall shopping center. There is a gas station, auto center, beverage/snack area along with a small waiting lounge. I will mention they sell liquor as well. The cashiers are very friendly and make you feel welcomed.  My first experience was kind of overwhelming. The gentlemen who check your car in are salesmen trying to upsell you on every product they sell you. I felt like the Groupon deal was a way to get you in the door then they hired pushy salesmen to get you to buy more. Since this was my first time I passed on everything. I explained to the man that it is my first time and I want to see how well they do. My car went through the wash quickly. The washers were fast. The silver wash is very basic. They did not even wipe  the seats I could tell from the light shoe marks on the back seat from a child who sat there in the past.   My second attempt was the same experience. So the third time I decided to upgrade to the platinum package to see how well they do. This time I was talked into a hand wax which went from $69.99 to $29.99 with a wash. I still said no and he gave it to me for $20.00 and I could use my last Groupon for the wash and he would upgrade me to a platinum wash. I decided to take him up on his offer. I was then approached to get my window fixed. I have a few tiny rocks that hit the windshield window. I passed on that service however I will say this salesmen Kenny was very nice. Non pushy and gave me his card when I was ready to get it fixed.  The third time around with the wax my car came out nice but they did not wipe the seats. I kindly asked the gentleman why and he said that the platinum wash only includes the dashboard not seats. He said I have to mention it when I check in. I think that is ridiculous as a platinum wash should include a seat wipe down. I don't expect them to be waxed but at least clean.   I don't plan on coming back as I have paid less money and had my seats wiped down at competing washes. Though overall I can say this car wash could do well. They are always fully staffed and move fast. Your in and out with no problems. If the men who check you in could be more personable like the cashiers it would be less intimidating. I also say check your car before you leave something I never do but if you pay for a wash make sure it truly is clean.",-1,0
"Overall, they cleaned decently. Not great, but not horrible. They seemed to do a very quick wipe down of the interior and the stuff they used causes the wiped down areas to be shiny, therefore, spots they missed were obvious. Externally, the job was meh. Decent enough where you can tell I had my car washed but still noticed some spots they neglected or missed. Additionally, they seem to always try and sell you something even when you go there knowing what you want. They always try and push for you to buy more and it gets annoying. They don't seem friendly either. Personally, only reason I'm going there is because I got a booklet of free car washes as a gift. Otherwise, I wouldn't be going there. Probably wouldn't recommend going.",-1,0
"All Walmarts are similar.  This one is no different than the countless others out there.  It's large, has plenty of cheap products, and is crazy busy.    I was at a friend's house on the other side of town and needed to buy more lawn chairs for his party.  He underestimated the number of people who attended his party....so, he asked me to run to Walmart to grab a few cheap chairs.  I found one for under $10....perfect, threw 10 of them in the back of his truck and headed back to his house.  We were able to pull the truck up to the curb and load in front of the store.  The employees there were cool about it and watched our chairs for us while we pulled the truck around the parking lot to the front of the store.  Overall, a pretty good experience.  Return Factor - 60%",-1,0
"This is the closest wal-mart to where I live and since the Basha's acrossed the street from my house closed about 2 years ago, I have been coming here.  They have good prices, however, unless you come before 9pm you will have to put up with pallet cluttered aisles and a lot of empty shelves.",-1,0
"As far as Walmarts go, this is the best one near to where I live.  It's pretty well organized, somewhat less crowded, and better stocked than others I've been to.  It is definitely 100% better than the mess of a store on Baseline & Stapley.  Parking is ample, too.",-1,0
This is the only Walmart that actually has a lot of items. When trying to find something I need at another Walmart I can't find it but can find it here and then some. Of course it is a Walmart so no registers are ever open and not very many people will assist you.,-1,0
"The positive about this place is that it's a time machine. The decor was modern in the 50s and they never changed it. Very cool to walk in there and imagine you were at an old soda fountain. I'm sure that is the appeal since so many in Madison went to the University of Wisconsin and come back to visit.   That said, the pancakes are big but not that good. The specials are not that great and the place is noisy and it's not very comfortable. Often times there are lines with tourists cramming their way in and the service is so so. The paintings on the wall are.....interesting....  The owner seems like a nice guy and he works hard and I give him big props for all the work he's put into it over the last 15 years. That said they need a menu overhaul.",-1,0
"Mickies Dairy Bar is an institution in Madison. It's excellent at what it does (no-frills breakfast and lunch diner food), but there's very little here that you can't either find better for cheaper at a place like The Curve, or that you could probably make as well as or better than Mickies in your own kitchen.  The ambiance is almost like stepping into a UW-Madison time capsule malt shop from the 1950s. They have old menu boards on display, the booths are weathered with a lived-in feel, the diner counter is an antique, and the bathrooms are tucked away under a squeaky wooden staircase. It can get impossibly loud on Saturdays, and I would abandon all hope of ever finding space on a Badger Football Saturday.  The service is quite good. Servers are cheerful, the kitchen is very fast (even when busy), and the coffee flows endlessly, as long as they aren't closing soon. I once wanted to do a crossword puzzle but had no writing utensil, so our server fetched one for me. They always remember to ask about the details of orders (such as whether you want gravy for your scramble on top or the side). He was pretty stingy with our coffee refills as soon as our food (quickly) came, though, since they were going to be closing. I get that he's probably exhausted - I used to work the weekend morning rushes at Marigold - but rushing us out like that (we'd gone in at least 45 minutes before closing) was obnoxious, since there were several other patrons still dining as we were leaving. If you are the kind of person who likes refills, I suggest trying a counter booth or counter stool, as you are more in their line of sight.  The food is hearty diner fare. You can order off of the breakfast meal all day, and possibly the lunch menu, too. They also have daily specials (at least during weekdays, except for Mondays when they're closed), which have generous portions and several accompaniments.The breakfast scramble is legendary, and an excellent hangover cure. It does need some salt and pepper, though. The two-egg breakfast is pretty cheap and good for an early weekday breakfast. The pancakes are enormous, and incredibly thick and heavy. A few bites are good, but I don't think I could even make it through a whole one. The coffee cake is a less-dense, delicious alternative if you like sweet food with your breakfast, especially when it has blueberries. Lunch-wise, they have fantastic sweet potato fries (sometimes), though the regular fries are nothing to write home about. The soups tend to be pretty good, but the sandwiches (toasted on the grill) are so heavy and greasy. You don't need to slather butter onto bread when you're making a Reuben with a ton of cheese and thousand island dressing; I love fatty diner food on occasion, but even this is beyond me.  The burgers are a safer bet. All in all, it's delicious and reasonably-priced after a night of regrettable drinking, but not something I crave on a regular basis.",-1,0
"Mickies, a Madison institution. Had to try it, glad I did, even happier that I won't have to again. Now, I will say that I am not a big fan of piles of breakfast foods covered in gravy, but their's was certainly nothing special. I got the Scrambler because that is what you get when you go to Mickies. It was good not great. The coffee was decent, the atmosphere was existent, all was satisfactory.   I am told that this place is packed most days and that on game days (like the day I attended) it has an hour plus wait. If I had waited even 10 minutes to sit down this place would have only gotten 2 stars. Just saying.  All in all it was a pleasant experience.",-1,0
"I had high hopes for this place. Mainly because I've heard a lot of great things about it, but our experience was forgettable.  My wife's family came into town from CA for our wedding and we chose this place for breakfast. The portions were enormous and most of them enjoyed their meals. My wife ordered the chocolate pancakes and she barely made a dent in it. Now this is a woman who will bathe in chocolate if she could, but she didn't care much for it. I had scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon and hash browns. It was pretty average.   Overall, everyone else thought the place was great because of the portions and most were hungover. My wife and I, the locals, weren't too impressed.",-1,0
"For a hangover, there is nothing like the Chili Omelet @ Mickey's Dairy bar.",-1,0
"The pancakes tasted like raw flour.  I couldn't really eat them because they were awful.  So I ordered some coffee cake, which was good, but nothing special.  We also had the scrambler.  I can't figure out why it was bad.  I mean it was okay.  Just very disappointing.  An bacon and cheese omelet on home fries.  I mean, eggs are eggs, right?  Cheese is cheese?  Home fries are home fries.  So I'm going to guess we just weren't in the mood for that type of food.     I kind of feel like a moron for actually criticizing greasy spoon quality food.  It's all basically the same unhealthy crap, right?",-1,0
"Only gambled here.  If you are the type who enjoys hole in the wall, no frills casino, this is the spot for you. Cheap tables and comped stiff drinks compliment the worn carpet well. I would have probably stayed a little longer here but got cleaned out quick. Otherwise, it was nice being somewhere that I did not have to lay down 20 bucks every hand.",-1,0
It was nice for the price. The room was very clean but the bathroom was very out dated and the shower would not keep a constant temperature. Upon check out the elevator broke down so I had to walk down 9 flights of stairs with my luggage. Room service was quick and the staff that I spoke with were very pleasant.,-1,0
I have had good luck gambling here. Love the 25 cent wings after midnight + cheap drinks. Cant go wrong.,-1,0
"Ok, so I went in expecting the worst, and it wasn't all THAT bad. The staff was fairly pleasant, and would bring us whatever we requested (hangers, towels, soap, etc..) right away. But this does not include the servers in the two restaurants inside. They gave my friend and I the absolute WORST service we ever had EVERY single time we went to either of them. At least the food was fantastic.  We chose to have a smoking room so I'm assuming that's why our room looked extremely old and outdated. We only had two electrical outlets in the room; one in the bathroom and one by the end of the room near the window. Everything was unplugged as well, and being that we had limited outlets we had to sacrifice light for the sake of having our cell phones charged.  We also had no way of plugging in our TV so that option was scratched. The cheep beer made up for our frustrations, but come on..this need to be worked on.   Ohhhhh! And our AC unit was from the Stone Age, and had apparently not been used for a while so we had a field day trying to get it to work. What a mission! We sweat pretty bad that first night, but thankfully we managed to get it started the next evening.",-1,0
"Love the wings, service is cute. We doubted our waitress would remember our order because she didn't write anything down but she was SPOT ON.  You know what you get in Hooters. Well done.",-1,0
Food was good. Also try some shrimp with your meal. They have pretty good customer service. I would come back again,-1,0
I forgot to update my review. They did invite us back and gave us 2 days to enjoy. Place is still not very impressive. They are doing renovations but they are modest at best. This would have been fine except I've noticed the prices have increased as well. All in all the earned a couple extra stars for trying to make things right. Oh and also when we got there are room wasn't ready for over 2 hours after check in time. Weird but this could have been a fluke.,-1,0
"Very similar to the Feast Buffets at other recent Station Casino properties.  The food was satisfactory.  We went on a Saturday night, so it was steak and shrimp night.  I did not see very many shrimp dishes.  The sirloin and NY steaks were decent.  Overall, a decent buffet, but for the same price, I'd much rather go to the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort.",-1,0
"Came here because my group was indecisive about what to have for dinner, so what better way to please everyone then to go to a buffet. This one is like any other local casino low key buffet. Food was good and it filled my belly, but nothing spectacular.   Pros:  -No wait at all for dinner on a Saturday night -Good variety: BBQ, Carving station, Mexican, Asian, Italian, Gelato -Cheap! Get an aliante card and earn yourself some discounts  Cons: -Quality was medicore -Some of the food had the appearance of sitting out too long",-1,0
"The buffet at Aliante casino is just average.  Almost everything was fresh but just average in taste and preparation.    The ribs were boiled, not grilled, but tasted okay.  The carved beef was decent, moist and cooked well.  The fried chicken was okay but the batter was kind of bland.  The spaghetti tasted like it had been sitting around a while, and the marinara sauce was just warmed-up tomato sauce.  The scalloped potatoes were actually pretty good, and I came back for a second helping.  They also had some really good ice cream in the dessert section.  I don't think I'd make a special trip to come back to this buffet.  The price was reasonable for a dinner buffet ($12.95), but there are better food choices in Las Vegas and definitely better buffets.",-1,0
"I'm reviewing the food I've placed on my plate. It's brunch so don't be freaked out what you read here.  Egg Benedict was very salty and the sauce was not made with real butter either. Tator tots were fine as were the biscuits and gravy. The potstickers I had were also pretty salty, they were tasty but the salt content in my eggs Benedict and potstickers was overwhelming, actually I think salty we be my adjective describing most of my food today. The steamed veggies were pretty good though. I did order a custom made omelet and that was very good. The waffles and blintzes were tasty as well.   I had a bite of almost everything but I was surprised by the overall saltiness in the food today. It's not always this way but today was abnormal I hope.  Summing  it all up, during brunch I recommend the custom omelet, blintzes with strawberries, a few strips of bacon, steamed veggies, and fruit. If you eat anything else may I suggest drinking plenty of water to flush the sodium from your body.  Peace",-1,0
"The place is pretty good and the only buffet in the neighborhood.  You can do much better on the strip, but it's a long drive.  This place has inconsistent food quality.  When things are slow they shut down large sections and you have little food to select from.   Some of the dishes are fresh and others are old.  They seem to be understaffed and slow to replace the missing items.    Be sure to use a players card to save $1 - unless than changed recently.",-1,0
"I've come here several times and unfortunately it's been sub par each time. I feel like they cut back on the fruit to save money. I've been a customer of Jamba Juice for years but this store's quality seems lacking. The employees are very kind and welcoming, however.",-1,0
"I don't normally go to Jamba Juice...it's my co-worker that chooses to go to this location...this review is based on this particular visit today... We've been here a few times and had no problems...my co-worker actually wanted me to review this place. Anyway, he ordered a Peanut Butter & Banana Protein Smoothie with Wheatgrass Shot... I told him to get me the same thing and I was there next to my co-worker listening to him order. He spoke clearly and the worker clearly repeated our order back to us...so when we picked up our order. We both looked at each other like, our drinks are not supposed to be red. The other worker that brought it out said he can make new ones if we didn't like the taste or if it was made wrong. My co-worker was in a rush and we didn't have time to wait. Needed to get back to work. It tasted ridiculous. My co-worker took a few sips and threw his away. We basically was given something off the menu. It was like peanut butter and strawberry...so you'd taste the peanut butter first, then the strawberry which was super sour...my co-worker was upset. I told him we should have changed it, but he said we didn't have time and because we're nice guys.......I'm sure it was just one of those rare mistakes a worker makes, but because of that...it doesn't get 4 or 5 stars...We'll see what happens on the next visit...  Update: 7-10-17:       A couple days after this review...the Director Of Operations at Jamba Juice replied to my review... We contacted each other through e-mail and in the end was given an opportunity to replace our smoothie for free at no charge, which we picked up today...It's great to know that voices are still being heard and that companies are reading and listening to their customers making sure to keep them rather than to lose them...First experience was a 3, but the outcome is truly a 5!...",-1,0
"Jamba Juice is a great little smoothie place located in various places around town.  It's big competition is the Tropical Smoothie cafe and both have pro's and con's.  One thing that Jamba lacks is the diversity in healthy options that Tropical Smoothie has.  Alas, Jamba Juice still offers great smoothie options like fresh fruit/no sugar added smoothies for the health conscious",-1,0
"The staff here is friendly.  I came here with a big group, 10 of us.  The male cashier was very patient and read back our order to confirm he got it correctly.  Impressive.",-1,0
"Admittedly I am not a Jamba Juice fan. However, for my birthday I received a gift card, and this is the closet Jamba to where I work. Due to the gift card, I've had the opportunity to enjoy what Jamba has to offer. I've had a variety of the fruit smoothies, the coffee smoothie and the tea smoothies. The fruit smoothies aren't really my thing because they taste very artificial to me. I watch them make the smoothies, I know fruit is in them, but they must put something else in there. I like the coffee smoothies, but the calories are crazy high in them. That being said, they are really tasty, and they are a bit more ""milk shake"" like than other smoothie brands I've had, so they are a bit easier to drink. The latest smoothie I had was the chai tea smoothie (with soy). I liked the flavor and consistency, though a bit more spice would have been nice.   The staff I've encountered at this  Jamba are exceptional. They are always friendly, always prompt, and always have a smile for me and the other customers in the store. The service alone, is worth 2 stars.   I probably won't hit up Jamba much after my gift card is used up, but I am happy I've been able to find a couple of the drinks I enjoy without having to pay for them :-)",-1,0
"Rating: 3.5  I visited this vendor for the first time with a friend in order to get our nails done for a special occasion. I requested a shellac manicure and a gradient nail. The employee helping me spent a bit more time blending out the gradient, in comparison to my friend's manicure time length, but my nails came out exactly the way I wanted and were very smooth. My nails also lasted longer than the 2 weeks that was communicated which was a pleasant surprise!  However, there was a bit of confusion over the price as I was originally quoted lower price than what I paid. I would recommend you confirm the price based on your design and after any adjustments (if any) are made while the manicure is being completed (i.e. adding gems) so that are no surprises when you get your final bill.",-1,0
"I went to salon plus to see cherry just a month ago and it was my first time going and they have a $28 package for french or 2 glitter gel or 1 colour and 15 rhinestones or something. I just got glitter tip and extensions. I would say cherry works really really fast. I actually prefer that then sitting there for 3 hours having my hand cramp lol. Their english isn't great, I didnt know how to say chunky glitter in chinese since i'm not amazing in cantonese so there was a bit of a hard time to communicate. She didnt take her time to push back my cuticles and cut them and do all that. She just toke the nail buffer and went for it. She fnished within an hour and those nails lasted me 3 weeks but I got tired of them cause they were growing too long and I went in again to get the removal and she didnt remove all of the gel for me cause she said my nails were too thin but that removal cost $10. I think this place was worth it for the price since I've paid 70 and had them break with in a week. My total came up to $38.",-1,0
"living in edinburgh, we're well spoiled for awesome parks so rating the smaller ones tends to force me to knock a star off.  it's hard to give over three stars when my four and five star ratings go to holyrood park with the beautiful backdrop of arthur's seat and the crags and then the meadows with it's massive green space and lovely community feel.  harrison park is a lovely park in the west of edinburgh though.  it's a fairly good size with a nice playground for kids and some playing fields for football as well.  also it benefits from being right along the union canal so it's a nice place to stop off for a break during a run or to meet to go for a cycle ride.    i can't think of much else to say for this park, it's lovely but on the smaller side.  still though, excellent place to meet for a BBQ when the sun is shining!!",-1,0
This spot is super unique and a great edition to Las Vegas. Even if you just go for dinner you are going to get the full bowling and concert experience because the open floor plan allows you to see everything. I'm rating my experience a 3 because the food was just alright. My red beans and rice were pretty dry and I was pining for more of the bean gravy. If I return I will definitely order the BLT. That thing was ginormous! If u want to go eat and bowl beware that there was a descrepancy between the hostess and server to whether or not they would carry over our tab to the bowling alley. Just plan ahead :),-1,0
"This review is for the restaurant only. I ordered wings, fries, milkshakes, and chicken platters. Even though our server was very nice we waited a LONG time to order, And longer for our food. They were definitely not busy, more than half of the restaurant was empty. Even though we waited very long when our food arrived it was hot. The chicken was average, good.....but average. The milkshake was good but not worth waiting 25 min for. They have a bowling alley next door, which is pretty cool.",-1,0
Had the chick-n-tots. Chicken was actually really salty. Almost inedibly. But the truffle tots were great.  Our server Domina was great. This is gonna sound weird but I was so happy when she asked for my ID. Been in Vegas for 2 days and no one asked for my ID. Thanks Domina.,-1,0
"The food wasn't bad but the customer service was horrible! Thomas, our server was probably one of the worse personalities I've been served by. He was basically a downer. After we asked for our bill, he just said 'ok' and walked away. He brought us the wrong tables check. When we told him about it again he said 'ok' and walked away. Where is my sorry! Honestly for the pricey food they serve here at least have servers who have more energy and care towards his customers. Anyway, never coming back.",-1,0

"Just a suggestion, but smile people!   Really, it makes the customer service experience better and not make people feel like spawn coming in for coffee.  Not sure if it was an off day here with the staff but talk about a unhappy group of people!   My coffee otherwise rocked! Perfectly hot just how I like it!",-1,0
"By far the slowest Starbucks I have been to. I have been here many times and i am always amazed at how long it takes to get in and out.  I live right up the street so hard to avoid but I definitely make a point to go to other locations if I am driving by one.  Just now, there was one person in front of me ordering a breakfast sandwich. From the time I walked in the door, it took 11 minutes to get an iced coffee in my hand.    I like Starbucks because I know what I am getting, but really dont enjoy going to this one in particular.",-1,0
"Decent coffee consistently, but suuuuper busy a lot of the time which means long waits. Actually, with just a few cars, the drive through is sometimes still very slow. I've also gotten the wrong drink on a driving order. A cappuccino is not a macchiato. Cinnamon dolce isn't white mocha. :/",-1,0
"It's a Starbucks: they burn the coffee beans and use really artificial flavors but I'm addicted and so are you so we all grumble and pretend to be coffee aficionados while take the mediocre drinks on our daily commutes.  They never mess up my drink here but the wait is horrendous. Like, expect to wait 10 minutes for your drink when you're the only one in the drive-thru. If there are people in front of you you'd better have a lot of extra time or hope  you don't care if you're late.   Another annoyance is the design of the drive-thru window with the curb. It's set like 3 feet back so when you pull up to pay/get your coffee you have to reeaaalllly reach out your window and even then you barely grasp the barista's hand to exchange money and get your beverage(s).   I go here everyday because it's the only drive-thru right by my house. But I complain every time I do.",-1,0
"This was our first time to this particular location and as the other reviews state - it was slammed both inside and in the drive-thru.  Took about ten minutes to get through the line, with about six people in front of me and about eight workers behind the counter.   They also don't seem to have any storage in their back room, since they had well over 20 merchandise boxes sitting around the the store and unopened.  They also had a large pastry metal cart with single wrapped pastries sitting on them.    The poor staff looked highly stressed and the cashier wasn't overly friendly, but wasn't rude or mean either.   My drink order was correct and tasted just like it should though, and let's be honest - at the end of the day, isn't that all that you really want from your coffee?  Overall: B It's a busy location with staff under pressure to get through lines and lots of seasonal merchandise to put on display. It wasn't an exceptional experience, but it wasn't bad either!  Still the good coffee I was expecting to get - so all is right in the world.",-1,0
"Very busy location, even the drive thru always has a line!    This Starbucks is probably not the best location to go to if you are in a big hurry.  Its hard to find a close parking spot.  Its also more difficult to get in and out of this particular stripmall because Tatum is usually packed.  Go to the light if you need to turn left!  The baristas have always been pleasant to deal with here.  One even took the time to look up the ingredients a a smoothie for me, so very accommodating.  I will say their bathrooms at this one seem to always appear dirty, yuck!",-1,0
"You know what? The price is right. That about sums up this place. This establishment continuously makes nationally recognized lists, and don't get me wrong it is an establishment, but sometimes too much hype leaves one aching for something more...If you've never been here before, relax. It's a diner not a Michelin star and your expectations should reflect that! :)  After a hike around the arboretum my fella and I decided we could splurge. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers (standard order comes with lettuce, tomato, american cheese, and pickles), cheese curds, and a vanilla malt. (Total of $19) Cheese curds were great - standard issue, normal serving, but who is going to argue against fried cheese!! The burgers were classic - served medium. I would sub the cheese for Swiss and ask for the bun to be toasted - but that's just me. The ""malt"" however was a low point...it lacked malt flavor, had lots of ice chunks, and was very thin...sorry but at $4.50 they can do better! - The server did give us two plastic cups and spoons - so splitting is not extra.-  I like this place. The old charm makes for a fun dining experience. With that being noted I think the location makes it more popular than if it were elsewhere in the city. But, all that said, if I found myself in walking distance I'd probably wander back in.",-1,0
"Three little words (On my God!)came out of our mouths when we saw the size of the pancakes on our plates. One plate was enough to feed an army. Of course, we didn't know it when we ordered so we ordered  three for our family. The pancakes were better than IHOP or other pancake places but I still think mine are better. :=). I like it that it is not a chain restaurant and you are supporting locals. But it wasn't a spectacular.  We heard good things about their pancakes so that's what we ordered but next time we go, we might order different thing just to try it out.",-1,0
"I asked the girl at the bar if they had fried pickles, she said no it's a seasonal item (not really seasonal - she said they only have it at some stores).. So I was okay with that. Then when she was handing me my bag I look at one of those little signs on the bar that has the promotions, there you go.. Fried pickles. WTF. I already waited to long to get my food, I didn't even bother ordering the fried pickles. Boo.  I still love their chicken wings. Love them.",-1,0
"Not sure what everyone is complaining about here. You get what you pay for.  Pros: Price Location - across the street from the MGM Grand Staff  Cons: Resort fee - latest Vegas scam that is meaningless Outdated - 27"" CRT TV A/C is not temperature controlled - it's either on or off  I've stayed worse places and paid more, not in Vegas but in other places.  I wouldn't pay full price to stay here ($75/night plus resort fee) but if you can find a really cheap deal where you pay $50-60 per night after the fee it is worth it.  Not much happening here and the strip is within walking/driving distance.",-1,0
"I give it 3 stars not because it's a 3 star hotel, but it's fine for staying there at a reasonable rate. the rooms are clean, the bathrooms are clean, the staff is good.

"As far as hotels go, this really wasn't such a bad deal. I shared a two-bed room with 3 other friends and spent only $25 per night. If you count the outdoor pool, decent sized gym, and a couple of $5 blackjack tables, this was a good and cheap find for our Vegas trip. The food however, was overpriced, subpar and well....hooters food, but that was expected.  Rooms: 3 stars Service: N/a Casino: 3 stars Food: 2 stars Price: 3 stars",-1,0
"This is our second time staying at this hotel while visiting Vegas- the first since it's been remodeled. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it only earned 3 stars because the new pool area earned the third.  Pros:  it's just on the backside of the strip, not far from MGM and Tropicana. If you don't mind a little extra walking, it's in a great location, especially for the price. The rooms have improved tremendously and are nicely redone. Spacious as well. There are also some joining rooms. Clean New pool area is great. It's smaller than many in the area, but they make up for it with games (beer pong, throwback games like hungry hippo, cards against humanity, and many more). It's full service and has indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a DJ from 1-6 on the weekends.   Cons: The AC in our first room sounded like it was going to bust. It clanked and was awful. We ended up in a second room (couldn't stand the noise and wanted to be closer to our other party, as they were on a different floor). AC was fine, but our room reeked like weed. It's legal in NV, but they are no smoking rooms.  The entire 6th floor smelled like weed the entire stay (7 nights). Our party moved because they had an issue with moths coming through their vent. They had a dozen in one night.  There is no fridge of microwave in the rooms, but there was before the remodel. Now they have to be rented per day. A fridge was $25 alone! You can't bring any outside beverages or food to the pool. You have to purchase theirs.    The customer service was okay. They moved us no problem and our other party, but they didn't really seem overly concerned about anything. They offered to let us move with the whole weed thing, but that would be room two, so we opted not to. They noted our stay to reflect my complaint so I wasn't charged the fee and we were not charged.",-1,0
"Stayed on 8/5/16 for 1 night @ $138 (all tax & fees included).  Positives: Among the best, last minute booking, price available so close to the strip. Within walking distance to the blvd. It is ,by comparison, worth the price. The view on the 18th floor was good. We checked in hours early and they were very flexible. Staff were friendly and respectful. Rooms were decent. The complimentary breakfast for 2 and the free $10 voucher for gaming is a plus. There were no issues, loud noises or other complaints. There is a small safe, iron & board, modern coffee machine and plenty of closet & drawer space. Modesty with woman is higher here then many others in Vegas.  Negatives: the room decor isn't bad but it is partially outdated. Windows were spotted with dirt. The tv was still the tube type. The A/C unit in the room was loud (like rolling thunder) and many others didn't work or looked old and neglected through out the public areas. Elevators were dirty. For 3 floors straight no beverage machine worked. No microwave and no fridge.",-1,0
"Hotel not bad if your on a budget. Most of the staff very pleasant. Only one complaint so far in all the times I've been here ( and that's quite a bit)...and that complaint is directly to a particular employee/ dealer Shaun. I've never experienced such rude behavior from a dealer. I was getting ready to sit down at a table along with someone else, who jokingly told Shaun ""be nice if I win u win"" her response "" I can't win if people at this table don't know what their doing"". Ummm awkward....I turned to look at the people at table who just looked at her. I got up and left. Don't need that negativity when I'm about to drop money.",-1,0
"It's a ok place. A little far from center of strip. Actually, walk 2 and half blocks to go to Bellagio hotel. Hotel is very quite, not many people in casino, and room has coffee machine which is a plus, because not many hotel in Las Vegas have coffee machines. They also have room with breakfast, so give you more choices. The hotel is decorated with woods, so didn't have the same feeling as many other hotels do, but the price is cheaper compared to other hotel. Overall, it's a fine place.",-1,0
"Ok overall. Carpet and bathrooms are GROSS. I didn't walk barefoot the whole time.  It was only 26 dollars on a Thursday night (45 total after tax, resort fees etc). That's the benefit- really cheap. Bed was comfy! Great location for the price. You get what you pay for. I'd recommend for a night or 2. Nothing longer than that.",-1,0
STAY AWAY FROM AZTEC COOKIE  Couldn't get thru one bite.  Seriously spicy is a understatement.  Wasted 2.75  The strawberry cookie was okay   Really Don't think I'm returning,-1,0
"Awesome food and great service! Don't miss out on the 'sides'.. I got the hummus and lentils, which were both amazing. I ran out of pita bread but they were nice enough to give me more upon request. I would also highly recommend dessert.. I got some kind if strawberry bar (forgot what it was called) but it was delish.  I also ordered the good earth sandwich which had really fresh ingredients, but the flavor profile of the sauce was kind of weird for me, I think I would order it without it if I was ever to go back again (I'm not from Nevada). I also ordered the guacamole sandwich, which I liked better.. But the I would have to say the red sauce on it was too sweet for me. I split these with a friend and we both felt the same about these entrees.   There was one other vegan sandwich option, tree of life, and I ordered all three for my boyfriend and his 2 other friends to split, and they liked the tree of life the best... So hopefully that helps!",-1,0
"The cafe gave me flashbacks to my college days with all the books, couches, and computers.  The cafe has many healthy options to chose from: salad, sandwiches, soups, deserts, and drinks.  The staff was friendly and pleasant. I had a sandwich and green drink. I just wasn't blown away enough by either to justify the price. A sandwich for 10$ better be one of the best I've ever had. It was good, but not great.",-1,0
Really yummy food. The fruit drinks on the other hand were not. I ordered the strawberry lemongrass drink and it was gross. Ended up throwing it away. They aren't cheap either.,-1,0
Was here last Friday for drinks and dinner with my husband.  Surprisingly - the food was quite good!  It's not the nicest / cleanest / posh place - being the 3rd oldest bar in Toronto or something like that....but I was impressed with the service and the food.  It was a positive atmosphere.  Food was a tad slow though although my partner thought it was okay. Maybe I was just really hungry.  I had the vegetarian lasagna (generous portion and quite delicious) and my husband had the beef stew - he said it was yummy!  We also shared the Wasabi hummus which was quite tasty!,-1,0
"This is one of Toronto's oldest bars - I believe it's been around for 70 years or so.  We came here for a Saturday night of live music (aBabe) and drinks with friends. The line up was eclectic but interesting... (I personally would have organized the three bands slightly differently but that has nothing to do with the bar... I digress)   Anyway, they advertised a diverse beer selection, which didn't turn out to be that big, but a good selection of local and specialty brews none-the-less. The beers were all $8, except for the Hogtown pale ale which was $7 - I believe they are aBabe's sponsor.  We didn't eat, but I'm curious to come back and try their oysters one Tuesday night. The bathrooms were so cold it felt like you were peeing outside. Decor was dark and moody but not dingy. Service wasn't bad but neither bartenders smiled even once so I also wouldn't call it friendly.  All in all, an okay place. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so either.",-1,0
Good rustic vibe. Interesting but narrow tap selection. Good and service was pretty good. Played the footy = good.,-1,0
I should love this bar. I love booze and I love nostalgia. But the general lack of patrons actually makes me uneasy.  I've often stopped in for a last drink of the night on my way home and there really isn't much of a scene.  Why isn't this place more fun?,-1,0
"I went here with some friends for dinner on a Friday night. Typical bar-type food, nothing too special. I like the simplified menu variety of beer available. It's apparently the 3rd oldest bar in the city which makes you appreciate the charming atmosphere. Great location and friendly service.",-1,0
"If you are looking for a bustling place, with lots of people to mingle with, this space isn't really for you. If you are looking for charming place with the odd character propped up at the bar, this may just become your local. There will never be a line up as it's usually quite empty so you are sure to get a cozy booth or table in mere moments.   The atmosphere is dark and mysterious and reminds me of a classic old hollywood film. The food there isn't your average pub food but quite tasty. (I really enjoy the crab cakes and the fries and Garlic Sauce)   If you need a space to meet up for pre-drinks or to catch up with friends, I would highly suggest this joint.",-1,0
"I absolutely love attending the classes and most of the instructors are great.   However, as for the machinery and free weights, it's a really cramped space. The stretching area is equally as awkward because it's somewhat of a tiny platform by the cardio machines.   I disapprove of any self-identifying health facility promoting tanning services, but Goodlife's marketing is especially bunk. They're currently using the advertising, ""looking to build a base tan?"" -- a concept which has repeatedly been discredited by scientific skincare studies.",-1,0
"(3.5/5) A good gym and connected underground to st clair station so its a comfortable trek in the cold.  Lots of machinery and services (juice bar and saw someone getting massage on site), clean and has friendly staff. However,  if you've been to one of the newer and bigger stand alone goodlife gyms, you will be a bit underwhelmed. The facility is tucked away underground and therefore smaller in comparison to its stand alone counter parts.  The machinery is in good working order but noticeably older.  When the group exercise room is in use there is only a small floor space available for stretching,  individual yoga or mat work, but this seems to be fairly common throughout the goodlife universe.",-1,0
"Took the BODYCOMBAT class.  Actual gym is right at Yonge/St. Clair and can only be accessed by street.  Not sure if actually can enter from underground where the subway is.  The gym itself is partitioned with treadmills, elliptical and cardio machines in a separate area as where the circuit machines and weights.  The fitness studio is of an average size.  There are TVs to each side of where the instructor teaches.  The floors do need to be updated.  Otherwise the condition of the mats and weights were standard wear and tear.    The woman's change room are decent and there are many.  I do like the there were coat racks and like all the other locations the benches are small.  The lockers are the smaller ones.  Didn't use the hair dryers but this location did have deodorant and hair spray available for use.  Overall, not the best but decent.",-1,0
"Very good pizza - EXCELLENT SERVICE - Friendly and attentive staff.  Large meat's pizza (8 slices) was $21.00 - good but expensive.  Papa John's is around $11.00 for the exact same thing.  For me, it's great for date night - but not to feed my 18, 20 and 22 year old sons.",-1,0

"The show was at our hotel, the Westgate Resort, so it was super convenient to hit while we were in Vegas. ***Definitely buy tickets online! We saved almost $30 per ticket in the VIP area just by getting them night-of on Vegas.Com.***  It was a fun show, ranging from classic burlesque performances to amazing pole performances, but I was hoping it would run longer. There were 5 numbers, and it lasted about an hour or so. Fun show for a night out!",-1,0
"S L O W employees. The few times I have been here there has been 1 employee working behind the counter and the line moved at snail speed. Don't go here if you're in a hurry. Maybe they're properly staffed in the mornings...both times I went it was late afternoon. I'd rather go to 92nd St or another one that's nearby.   I will say, that both times I went here my drinks tasted awesome so I haven't completely written off this location.",-1,0
"7/22/11  Came in to redeem my complimentary birthday drink- chose a large Very Berry Refresher, a green coffee-based black raspberry drink rehydrated from a mix.  I enjoyed it very much, but I doubt I'll order it again, now that I know it's a rehydrated mix drink...    Service was very friendly, and the two women there were very patient w/ my questions about the new Refreshers.  I appreciate the free birthday drink, and I will continue to come here once in awhile for hot or iced black coffees!  :)",-1,0
"So another day, another Starbucks.  This time the adventure took me from my usual iced espresso to a more exotic and unique flavor....the venti iced coffee with not one, but two pumps of classic syrup.  To finish it off I added some half and half on the top.  Note to everyone obsessed with using ""skim"" or non fat milk- when hitting ice, you do need the small fat content so the milk doesn't become watery.  So yes, it might be a whole 20 to 30 calories more but will make the drink taste so much better.  Loved it, and probably will try it again.  Place of course was great with the service being positive and uber friendly!",-1,0
"I've been to this Starbuck's a few times now. It's conveniently located in the AJ's shopping plaza, near a dentist, salon/spa, and Flo's. It does not have a drive-thru but there's plenty of parking in the morning. (In the afternoon it's a madhouse due to the lunch rush at Flo's.) The employees have always been nice and courteous. I've never had to wait very long for my drink, which is nice when I'm in a hurry in the morning. They do have plenty of seating both inside and out, so that's a plus. I usually see folks enjoying the outdoor seating with their dogs or while still wearing their workout clothes. Overall, it's another Starbucks. Same items and service you experience and expect at any other Starbucks.",-1,0
Need more tables inside... There's one big one but that should be swapped for a few little ones to make it more comfortable! Otherwise everything is great. Nice barista. Fast service.,-1,0
"This place can be hit or miss, especially in the mornings. If Corbin is working (strawberry blonde barrista), you'll be assured to have your drink ready by the time you finish paying. Yes, he's that quick. Other barristas I've had there have made me wait so long that I actually asked for my money back.   I think it's a training starbucks, so it's very likely you'll get a trainee. If you're patient, you'll be rewarded. They're all very nice and friendly.  As if you need recommendations for what to get, I like their vanilla lattes, and their protein boxes.",-1,0
This is one of the worst experience with Starbucks.,-1,0
"I'm from the Bay Area.  Starbucks is no Peet's (the best coffee in my book) but, you know, it's available.  Be sure to REGISTER your Starbucks Card!  Free drink on your birthday, free refills after 5 purchases, and when you hit Gold, free purchase every 12.  They have a couple special touches; the free downloads and apps for your iPhone, the Starbucks app which tracks your rewards.  The breakfast sandwiches are good, and if you have to pick up a quick lunch to go, their little grab and go options are doable.",-1,0
"Okay. Wal Mart. What can I say? I guess I can say I frequent this particular Wal Mart the most out of any Wal Mart in Las Vegas. I've been in a lot of Wal Marts. They don't differ much. Unless you count the Wal Mart in Seward, Nebraska which has a claim to fame: it's the smallest ""super"" Wal Mart (groceries included) in the United States. Woo hoo, right?   Like I said, Wal Mart is Wal Mart. There will always be trashtastic people and cheap goods. Cheap groceries and that icky feeling that slimes it's way down your back as you enter, knowing you're contributing to the evilness of the Wal Mart Empire.  However, Wal Mart has a few redeeming factors, which I will list here:  #1 Deli Pizzas. Seriously, I'm not even joking. The pizzas found in their deli section are delicious. They're the take and bake kind and they're better than Pizza Hut or Dominos. In fact, they're better than most frozen pizzas.   #2 Nordicware Bakeware. Nordicware has become my favorite bakeware. It's sturdy, tough, and heavy, AND it is MADE IN THE USA. I try my best to keep my purchases on the USA side. But beware - some things Nordicware items are now made in China (mostly plastic things). So just read those labels!  #3 Anchor, Sterilite, and Pyrex - Also all brands made in the USA for the most part. Again, check the label to make sure!  #4 If you're in a pinch, there's always a Wal Mart. Is that a good thing? Maybe not, since it's an obvious sign of the monopolized times. BUT, somehow, someway it is also helpful.  That's Wal Mart. Oh yes, this one is quite ghetto. But one could PROBABLY say that about ANY Wal Mart.",-1,0
"Well, as always To many customers and not enough cashiers. But when you finally get to the register, the cashier is always hospitable and friendly. I like this one because its not as Ghetto as some of the other walmarts.",-1,0

There is one good thing about this Walmart which is why I give 3 stars. The people watching here is top notch!!!!,-1,0
"This Walmart is huge and cheap, like your mama... ha ha ha, just kidding.  But seriously, it's a pretty good place to go when you need to get something and you don't want to spend a lot of money.  The customers can be pretty darn ghetto at this location, but then again, I'm guessing that most Walmarts are built in areas that are more... urban.  I am tempted to give this place two stars, but the deals are so good that it earns an additional star.  Again, go here if you're looking to save a buck on whatever you're getting.",-1,0
"We have been going to Bucky for 5 years. Their grooming is 5 star material; their customer service skills are more like 1 or 2 stars. Our dog has very thick hair and takes a while to bathe and groom. In the past we were always charged $85; today when we went to pick our dog up we were unexpectedly told it would be $100. There is a small sign saying prices are subject to change and that if it takes two people they reserve the right to charge $10-$15 more. I think this is fair; however, I feel since we have been loyal customers for so long and they had groomed our dog so many times, they should have either warned us last time we were in that there would be an upcharge next time or alerted us of the upcharge when we dropped him off--we probably would have understood, no sweat off our backs. However telling us upon pick up it would be $100 instead of $85 was poor customer service. Bucky Adams are excellent groomers, unfortunately we will be moving on elsewhere.",-1,0
"This update is for the bar area.  This place is a favorite of mine when I am in the area. Not for the quality or prices, but for the atmosphere and convienance.  The beer is always cold, the vodka martini is good but they gotcha by the cohonas for the bill over all.   Today I went for the ""royal treatment"" and ordered the 17.00 wings dish. Thankfully I can expense it, but it is pricey. But,    I will say the wings were just as I like them crispy hot and tender with a side of veggies and some fries.. check the picture.   I like this place because its simply, it's comfortable and quiet at most times. (Talking about the bar itself) I am not looking to pickup or chat up anyone I am looking to sit at the bar watch TV and enjoy a bit of relaxation being stuck on the road without my sweetie.  This place makes me feel welcome and comfortable. I wish the prices were a bit better, but as I said the convienance and other factors make me always stay here to rather than drive to any of the numerous other joints in the area.  The staff are mostly long timers that are friendly and very proffesional. Just don't ever order the butter chicken",-1,0
"First off this is a dine in experience and only one visit. I had the Turkey and cheese sandwich. For about 8$ for lunch. Not a bad value at all. I was stuffed. I was served quickly and really enjoyed the sandwich. To dine in it is hot. Not sit there and sweat like crazy hot but still warm. A customer actually said ""wow it's actually a little cooler in here today"" while I was eating.  Seats are uncomfortable. No restroom. My plate was obviously a little old and had some pizza sauce stains in the cut marks. Good food and good service +++ atmosphere and comfort --",-1,0

If you know anything about pizza, you know the simpler the better.

"Stopped in on Thursday night for Karaoke. It was moderately busy when we arrived with a couple of large groups. We seated ourselves and waited a little bit before our waitress came to greet us. We ordered our drinks and they were brought out in a timely manner. The menu is filled with typical bar food selections and many other yummy offers. The food is very good. We ordered the honey bbq wings. They were very good. The decor is modern divey. There is Karaoke Tuesday, Thursday Friday and Saturday. The noise level can get loud depending on the type of music being sung/played and how busy it is. This place is A-ok in my book and we will be back.",-1,0
"November 2015  I went with a few people who are frequent flyers of this place.  The waitress was friendly, quick to refill orders, and took the time to chat it up for a bit.  The food was the quintessential bar food you get any ""dive"" bars - so don't expect much.  I got the Pollo Arizona which come on a potato hamburger bun, grilled chicken, one slice of melted Monterrey jack cheese, a tablespoon of green chilis, 2 tomato slices, a large leaf of lettuce, and mayo.  Not sure why it is called that, since it's not very southwestern.  I wish there was a southwestern sauce, or something to add spice/flavor to it.  The side salad was good, but the Italian dressing seemed watered down.  There is shuffleboard, darts, and TVs galore.",-1,0

However, there is a blond waitress (Missy?) who is absolutely terrible and pays no attention. If you get her you should probably just walk out. Tasty otherwise!",-1,0
"Really enjoyed their chicken. Eat it with the spicy habanero sauce and honey. On top of thick cut TX toast, yummy. Though I will admit... it's a bit pricey.   The venue itself is big and airy, and I like the idea they're going for. The open concert floor is pretty big, and good for a small-medium sized show. But not sure if that would distract from the bowling or the bowling distracts from the concert, because it shares the same space.   I went on a Friday night, with no particular band that I recognized playing... the bowling area was full, the patio and side table area were busy. The side beer pong/game area was empty and the concert floor was pretty empty too. I appreciate it not being crazy crowded, but I'm thinking the size and emptiness of the place when there's not a particularly popular band playing sorta takes away from the atmosphere. I enjoy live music but want a cozier feel.   The service was decent. Nice, and  they checked on us regularly. I don't really need too much. Keep in mind the chicken can take a while to come out, but they usually warn you. Just good to know that going into it.   Great possibilities here.. will need to check it out another time to see how it grows.",-1,0
"The hard part was getting into the venue. Such a process and time consuming. This particular night was Tuesday Blends. Showcase of dancers and last night was their award ceremony. Congrats Jabbawockeez!  We had a large party of 15 people.  Got quickly sat for dinner. Decent view of the stage which is great for enjoying the show while you eat.  Drinks came quickly.  Dining area wasn't busy. Time definitely passed. Just under an hour before we received our food. The bright side was they got our orders correct, wasn't necessary to ask for anything additional, and they kept the drinks flowing.   Pork sliders - tender meat, crunchy pickles, decent taste (nothing I would particularly crave again) portion of 3 was great for me and my small appetite  Mac n cheese - great portion, shredded chicken, good flavor (I would order this in the future)  BLT - soooo much bacon, a bit overwhelming  Chicken wings - I don't prefer bbq flavor. It has very strong bbq flavor as if it came off the grill.  The table really really enjoyed these.      After dinner We preceded upstairs to join our friends.  They are extremely strict about the VIP area.  One of us didn't have. a wristband. Though our group was directly involved in the evenings event, security really gave us a hard time.  We had a few obstacles to overcome. It's overall a great venue that I always enjoy with all of my friends.",-1,0
"Great venue for concerts, this is my 3rd time visiting Brooklyn Bowl but my 1st time actually having a meal here.  Prices are comparable to all other establishments on the strip.  Overall it is a 4-star rating, but the food on the other...yeaaa.  Went to a show with friends, split the fee for the reserved couch area, $300 for the couch on a Friday night?  You cannot beat that, a super amazing deal, the $300 is a food/beverage credit.  So, if you have friends like mines, then eating and drinking up $300 of worth of stuff is an easy task.  As a group, we ordered (scale rating 1 - 5): - Baked Mac & Cheese baked in a small casserole dish, underneath a crunchy layer of cheese is creamy spiral noodles.  Even though the noodles were cooked perfectly and it had the right ratio of creamy-ness to noodle was great, it lacked flavor for me.  My favorite part of the dish was the 'cheese crust', cheese broiled into that bubbly goodness, once cool it's like a gooey, crunch, chewy cheese Chip. YASSSSSSS and please, cheese chips all day.  Rate: 3   - Rock -n- Roll Fries I would and will order these everytime I come here, this is the American version of Poutine.  Shortstring fries, smothered in house gravy,melted on top a mix of provolone and cheese, sprinkled with some kind of cajun spice.  You know it's good when you wipe you finger along the bottom of the plate to sop up what is left of the gravy.  Yes I did and it was finger licking good.  Despite the french fries being slathered in gravy, there is still a light crisp to the french fry when you bite into it.  It is enough to share with 4, but I'm telling you, you may want to order 2 orders...1 for the group and 1 for you. Rate: 5 (HELLS YA THIS IS A STRONG 5)  - Really Sloppy Joe in my Homer Simpson voice ""mmmmm, really sloppy joe"", this was a surprise to me.  I liked a lot better than I thought I would.  The mac&cheese may have been lacking flavor for me, but the Sloppy Joe was a PARTY OF FLAVORS!  Piled high, spilling over, packed between a sesame seed bun.  Sweet and tangy beef, diced onions and green peppers, not too WET to where it looks like soup with a side order of bread, nor too DRY to where it meat is crumbly like taco meat on a bun.  that is a TORTA, I did not order a Torta, I ordered a REALLY SLOPPY JOE and it was just right.  Now take some Rock -n- Roll and break a piece of sloppy joe off, put fries on top of and/or inside of bun (choose your pleasure) and E-N-J-O-Y.  It is total UMAMI! Rate: 5  - Chicken Wings for me, not my favorite. breaded wings, it was crunchy but not seasoned.  A little salt and pepper...um, no. Maybe some Lawry's seasoning salt?  Have the dipping and hot sauces near by.  When you're drinking though, it doesn't matter, buuuuutttttt.....if you stack some Rock -n- Roll on top, man U-M-A-M-I Rate: 1 (3 if you stack it rock -n- roll fries)  - Chick & Tots refer tot he comment above   Overall, I like the vibe here.  Cool, laid back, and very affordable especially on a Friday.  Grab 5 of your friends and have a BIG PEOPLE bowling night.  It is totally worth it, Friday night on the strip, about 4-5 drinks per person + food, shoe rental and unlimited bowling...C'mon, go check Brooklyn Bowl and treat yourself to a VIP night of fun",-1,0
They are new and are still working the bugs out.  Hours posted outside differ from website. (see photo)  Taxi drop off is NOT available at the time of this review.   Standing room only to view the concert.  The mixed drink I tried was expensive and not drinkable. I had to toss it out as it tasted like gasoline. I asked for something top self and they didn't carry it.  Sound was good.  Place was kept clean as people were dropping drinks and the workers were quick to clean up.,-1,0
Venue is very nice! But stop advertising concert start times more than 2 hrs before the actual start in order to get ppl into spend money before the show and then when the show starts charge an arm and a leg! for drinks!

"Other than the High Roller, this is probably the biggest landmark on the LINQ Promenade and it certainly is a huge place once you get up the escalators inside.  Brooklyn Bowl is a House of Blues meets Lucky Strike in my opinion, although the menu is heavily soul food influenced.  I'll admit it. The main reason I came in the first time was for the fried chicken dinner and it was extremely filling.  The chicken itself was good, but I'm not sure it was worthy of some of the lofty praise that I've heard on TV and here on Yelp. And I even dipped some of that chicken in a mixture of honey and hot sauce that was the in-house recommendation to add even more flavor.  I might even argue that the collard greens were the best thing on my plate. They were simply sensational. No complaints on my mashed potatoes and gravy either.  There was even a second trip back down the promenade to try the Chicken Muffaleta (Never saw that anywhere else on a menu), but Brooklyn Bowl was sadly closed entirely that night for a private event.   While I didn't bowl or attend a concert, I would certainly do either here and think it would be very enjoyable.  They have an afternoon Happy Hour and another starting at midnight with half-priced drafts and appetizer specials. And if you find a young lady named Angela working one of the bars, stop right there, sit down and enjoy her sweet smile and excellent service.  Not that I had one, but PBR drafts are way overpriced at Brooklyn Bowl. Honestly, if you're going to ask for over $6 for that beer...there really is no reason to even have it on tap.   And just as I was finishing dinner, they started up karaoke and I honestly couldn't pay my check fast enough. While I dislike karaoke anywhere, the volume here was way too loud considering I was sitting nowhere near where they were doing it.",-1,0

"A great place to see a band and still able to eat. But if you stood in the back, it was hard to see the band as the stage is not very high. The bowling alley was a nice fit, for while you wait, along with the restaurant. But the food at the restaurant was lower than mediocre, the wings were super fried but the amount of sauce used on them were over powering and made them soggy. Along with having to wait twenty minutes to be seated and then having our order taken, I should of just ate pizza from the place down the street and fought the cold then come in here and pay too much for bad wings and overpriced beer. But the three stars is for the atmosphere, loud music and being inside.",-1,0

The food is really good and semi healthy, however the staff is such a buzz kill.  My last visit, my waiter was either stoned or drunk, i couldn't tell. He looked annoyed he even had to say hi let alone attempt to get our order right. After F* up our order twice, he sat in the corner gabbing with another server about how hungover he was and couldn't wait to be off.  My girlfriend spent several minutes trying to flag someone down for our check, but no one could be bothered. I guess when you have drinking stories to share--who cares about getting paid? If they would hire new staff and adopt the mantra ""care about our customers"" then maybe I would go back...",-1,0
"Let me preface this with a simple statement: I absolutely LOVE the food from Pita Jungle!  That being said, there are a few things that irk me about Pita Jungle.  First, the music is very loud. I'm noticing this is a common theme with the new wave of restaurants that are opening. I have asked a couple of times if the music can be turned down, but the reply I hear over and over (at multiple locations, mind you) is that the music is at ""company standard"" and that I can sit outside. This is rude, considering it is the middle of the summer in Phoenix.  Second (and this is a personal problem), I really, really wish there were french fries. I know this sounds silly, but they really do taste amazing with hummus. Oh well, the personal battle ensues.  Third, most of the people that are hired are pretty snobby and incompetent. This sounds rude, but I was in the customer service industry for a long time. I know I have high standards, but I minimally expect people to do their jobs.  Anyway, I eat here all the time. I just get the food To-Go :)",-1,0
"Good place to stop for a healthy meal! Service was good, hummus was good, and the pizza was okay.  Not my favorite type of pizza, but I was sharing a meal and everyone else enjoyed it.  They have great Pitas and a small, but good, selection of beer on tap. Worth stopping in if you are in the area for lunch or dinner!",-1,0
"My friends love this place more than any other in Phoenix.  This time we went and ate a sampler platter, falafel, and iced tea (they have several flavors-excellent!).  We didn't order an actual entree, but the platter was filling and tasty.  Pita Jungle still isn't my favorite place in town, but if I stick to the basics they'll be satisfying.",-1,0
"If you are looking for authentic Greek food or even an authentic tasting gyro, skip Pita Jungle and hit one of the many mom and pop Greek restaurant's around Phoenix. The food is descent, but because of the crowds that flock to the Jungle, food is usually cold by the time it reaches the table. I had previously been to a different Pita Jungle (Chandler area) and remembered the food to be tastier, but it too had the same problem with slow service.  Today I visited with my husband, because he has heard mixed things about the Jungle and wanted to decide for himself. To say the least, he was not pleased with his first. We were sandwiched between two other couples in an attempt to maximize seating in an already over crowded restaurant. We heard the couple to our left complain multiple times that the glasses and silverware were dirty. After about 15 minutes the waiter finally appeared to take the drink order and attempted to flee before we even gave our food order.  On a positive note, the prices are cheap, and the beer and wine selection is commendable. I was happy to end the meal with something yummy after the all-too-cold falafel.....pistachio ice cream/baklava plate. Next time, if we feel the need to stop by the Jungle, it will be for beverages and dessert only. Try to hit this place up during off hours as well for a more enjoyable dining environment.",-1,0
"I like pita jungle just like anyone else, but I think it is given too much cred.  The Fake Mediterranean stuff like the lavosh pizza are good, but I can't really say that anything else is anything but adequate.  Falafel is ok there.  The most bangin thing is the red pepper hummus, but I would just buy it to go, cause to me, the pitas taste like they bought them at fry's.  Salads are huge here, if you're into those for a meal.  Other than that it's just doing what it's supposed to, nothing above and beyond.  I usually find that it's very crowded there too.  I would rather hit up Haji's.",-1,0
"The food is great here, and they are pretty big meals. I always enjoy the food and love having the left overs for lunch the next day. I have been here often but have never had a very good experience with the staff. They are always very short with us and don't seem to enjoy serving. However the food is very good so I will keep going back.",-1,0
First time visiting  this location.  The food  was decent. Not great . Had the hummus with pita. Tried their lentils  soup . This was flavorless.  Tried their yellow fin tuna salad and phili cheese steak . Service was attentive,-1,0
"This location is a lot more pleasant to dine at then it's Scottsdale location.  The Scottsdale location is always busy with Scottsdale's finest soccer moms. Screw that.   Pita jungle is a decent place if you are looking for food that is a bit healthier. Lots of vegetarian and light fare is offered here.  I always get the same thing, because I am a meat eater. The Gyro pita with a side of the Garlic roasted potatoes. I am disappointed that they use the preformed fabricated gyro meat for this pita. Would like to see them use the fresh shaved meat. But by judging the clientele, I'm sure it's one of the least popular pitas.   Service is always adequate. Great spot to grab a pita and iced tea and hang out.",-1,0
"Please,  please,  please change back your iced tea!! Admit that you made a mistake with this change and go back.  We used to come here at least once per week, sometimes twice per week - now maybe once per month.  All due to the HORRIBLE chemically tasting iced tea.  Even when we do come our bill now will always be $6 - $12 less since we only order water now.  (Good for us,  bad for you)   Saving a few cents per glass isn't worth losing loyal customers.  Every visit I ask,  as the universal answer is ""the owner decided to change it.""  I'm reply,  I have to say,  ""tell your owner he is an idiot.""  Seriously though,  this is a really bad business decision.",-1,0
"*Dinner* I went to Brooklyn Bowl for dinner and to watch college basketball. Brooklyn Bowl was busy after opening in the evening. Brooklyn Bowl has a dining section,bowling alley, and music venue inside. I sat at a window seat in the dining area (good view outside by The Linq). I ordered 8 pc chicken wings and fries. The chicken wings and fries were average (IMO). I expected more from Brooklyn Bowl chicken after reading reviews. I'm born in the South,I have high expectations for fried chicken. Our waitress was decent. Brooklyn Bowl has a cool ambience and a lot of televisions (very lively). I only ate here, next time I would come back to bowl or check out the music venue. Brooklyn Bowl is a cool place to check out in Las Vegas.",-1,0
"Fun place...Fried chicken was the bomb.  Ribs had good flavor but not very meaty.  Knish was yummy....  Bread pudding was ehhhh...  Very good service though, super nice.",-1,0
"Was here as part of a private group event so not sure how they operate for individual guests.  I did not bowl, but they have lanes.  They also have pool tables.  The menu looked interesting and I heard rave reviews about the fried chicken, they did not offer that to us.  They had a DJ.  It is located next to the new ferris wheel attraction, shopping and many other bars/restaurants.  I agree with another reviewer who says it is a House of Blues meets Lucky Strike.  They have concerts as well.  It is two stories and very large . . . should not have to wait and they have plenty of bars.  Enjoy!",-1,0
"I want to start by saying that Brooklyn Bowl is amazing as a concert venue. Although the opening band was so fun, we were hungry, having not eaten before, so we went to the restaurant to eat before the main act. It was awesome that we could be seated and still listen to the music.   Our server was amazing and friendly, but we waited at least 15 minutes before anyone took our drink order. I had to stop a manager and ask who our waitress/waiter was because no one had introduced themselves yet.  The food was amazing - fried chicken is a MUST! Also, their main shake with Nutella and a shot of bourbon (that's how it's listed!).   We had a great time, and would probably eat there again, but the service was a little sub-par. She didn't check in on us much, which was noticeable because there were a few times we needed something and didn't know where she'd went.",-1,0
"Ambiance was good.  I would not recommend for a romantic date hard to hear one another with music playing but good for a fun spontaneous date.  Food was okay over prices. Paid $20 for 4 pieces of chicken, the greens were disgusting.  The veggie sandwich was a little dry i had to remove one bun in order to enjoy it a little more. I asked for sauce but they just had ranch and bbq (dumbs down on that)  Staff was friendly and the ambiance was relax and nice.   I would return but not foe the food maybe for a drink",-1,0
"Not too shabby. They do have an excellent binder available behind the counter with allergies and even a menu outlining which items are vegan or can be made vegan.  I went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles which just had a hint of spice. i did enjoy the thick Udon noodles with mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots. The mushrooms and broccoli seemed a little sparse, they were all just small pieces mixed in. The tofu i added to the dish was done well, but again didn't seem to get a ton. Overall, it's a good place to meet someone working at the hospital for lunch.",-1,0
"I really love the atmosphere of this place!  Was here last week for lunch and the menu has something for everyone, even tofu is an option for your bowl!!  YUM!  The concept is a bowl of noodles and you can pick how you want them, Italian, Asian etc etc. with add-ons like chicken or meatballs etc.    I got the Spicy Asian Chicken bowl and my noodles were over done and the sauce was like peanut butter mixed with water...weird texture and flavor.  BUT my friend got the chicken pad thai and he couldnt finish it so I polished it off for him.....delicious!!!     I will go again and try more things on the menu because why would I just go here for pad thai when I can get the best pad thai in Charlotte at the Thai House??  I wish I could give 3 and a half stars because even though it is a little pricey (16 bucks for two people WITH a bogo coupon???), the portions are pretty large, you could easily split a noodle bowl with someone.  All in all NBN is rounding off at A-OK!  :-D",-1,0
"This place is as the name suggest 'nothing but noodles'.  They offer several pasta dishes with different sauces and you have the choice to add meat to some dishes and others already have meat.  The combinations are nothing special and somewhat overpowering sauces.  The beauty of this place is that they sponsor many fundraisers for area schools, ETES being one and 25% of proceeds go to that particular school during that time which is great reason to support this place.",-1,0
"I wish I could have gone 2.5 instead of three.    The cashier/order taker was being trained and was slow and didn't speak great English and didn't know how to count change.  The cooking of the food was slow as well.  Maybe I just expected it to be faster than it really is.  Staff were friendly.  The Beef Stroganoff is a bit bland, but I like things sauce-y, so I added some creamy marscapone to it when I got home & it really brightened up.  It could use a little more meat in the noodles, but the noodles weren't overcooked, which was good since I had to drive them home.  I just wanted some noodles without fuss, so this fit the bill for this evening.  Relatively easy to get in and out of except for the construction they are doing on Hawthorne, so you have to go around the block to get there... you can cut across Torrence from 4th (I think it's 4th).  Mangia!",-1,0
"Pretty standard noodles place.  The food was good and the place was clean.  Nothing bad, but nothing I would write home about, either.  I would definitely come back because you get a lot of food for not a lot of money.  My $10 noodles was enough for two nights' dinners.    All in all, pretty solid but not spectacular.",-1,0
"The food is ok, lobster ravioli was wayyyy too spicy for me.  I got the shrimp scampi too, it could have used a little more sauce.  The meatballs, right out of a bag.  I'll go back and try something different soon.   Cashier always has an attitude, the rest of the staff are just stone faced.",-1,0
"This place has been hit or miss for me the few times I've been. The Caesar salad and pad Thai were both pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend any of the soups",-1,0

"Alright so here's the deal. Back home in Jerz, me and my gf found this phenomenal noodle place- Wild Noodlez. We go back one day, CLOSED. Our lives were a little less fulfilling without Wild Noodlez.  When I moved down to Charlotte and stumbled (and I literally mean stumbled, I fell on the curb walking there) across this place, it was like the sun began shining on my life again. I decided to wait until my gf came down for the summer to take her there. Needless to say, she was game the second she heard the title.  The place is a little bland. It didn't give me what I NEEDED. I feel like the menu OD'ed on different ethnic foods. I was simply looking for outrageous meals that include noodles, not so much just pad thai or pasta.   I'd like to see a little less seafood and ethnicity when I check out the menu. The food is still good and serving beer (thumbs up)  Check it out if you are looking to try something new.  LBD scale- 6. Could be great with some minor menu touchups.",-1,0
"well let me start by saying... it's Jack Astors. you don't want to except the best, but you know your up for a great time.  This location was not too bad, the service was slow in the beginning in terms of our waitress getting to our table with drinks (it was packed due to the bluejay's do or die game---yay jays). She did not do the usual routine of introducing herself and writing her name backwards(applause for all jack's waiters' and waitress- this is definitely a skill), which is again not a big issue. She was a sweet, polite, just doing her job waitress. It took a really long time for our drinks to come, but our wait time for our food wasn't bad at all, I guess the bar was busy due to the game.  I don't stray to far from my ordinary choices when it comes to Jacks so late night I chose the Asiago Chicken bow tie pasta with sun dried tomatoes. you can never go wrong with this dish. My fiancé had the fish and chips which looked and smelled delish, I didn't try but he said it was pretty good.   overall, I do not think I would visit this particular location again unless forced to by someone else, but I would still visit any other jack's.",-1,0
"The food at Jack Astor's is normally good as it is a restaurant chain. I salivate over the nachos, quesadillas, and of course their garlic pan bread.  But I was disappointed when I had the chicken fingers and fries.  The best was the fries, they had the perfect crispness and cooked perfectly.   However the chicken fingers were lacking.  I had the breaded version with panko crumbs instead of sauced.   I found the chicken to be quite bland and ended up saturating each morsel with the dipping sauce that comes with the order.  Obviously if I had them with sauce that would add flavour to the chicken, but you'd think they would have a special seasoned breaded type also.  Again, this wouldn't stop me from going to JA's I'll just opt for the nachos over the chicken fingers!",-1,0
"Is this Canada or the United States? After the appetizers they had ""entrees"", certainly they mean main courses, since entree in the Queen's English means appetizer. The food was good, the service was fine. Waiter almost lost his hand taking away my plate while other people were still eating at the table. (Again, this is Canada, you clear the table when everyone is done, not while others are still eating.)",-1,0
After it became impossible to find a decent place in uptown to watch UFC. We ended up looking for a go to place in the suburbs. This one fits the bill the steaks here are OK and they have humongous multi-panel screen. Beer selection is limited so I ended up with Stella. I had the butter brushed sirloin steak with a side of sweet potato fries. Buddy had the New York. The Steak was grilled to our liking and the meat was good (at these prices we were not expecting miracles). There is no cover for UFC and this place does get packed. One of the better spots to watch UFC IMO as the audio/video setup is really nice.  3.5 Stars for watching UFC.,-1,0
"Popped in here on a Friday night with my girlfriends for a GNO. The line up to sit was crazy, we waited about 45 mins to get seated and that too we got the restaurant over the bar.  the service was okay, managing for how busy the restaurant was, but it was more ""flag me down when you decide"" instead of ""what can I get you today?""   the food came out in a timely manner along with our drinks. The server was very interested in pitching a job there to us, letting us know how much he makes a year in tips (total turn off from the restaurant).   I've always had a bad experience at restaurants in this plaza. there was nothing amazing about my visit nor was here anything horrific to complain about, definitely won't be a first option to return too.",-1,0
"My boyfriend got his haircut here just for the hell of it. For $12 it was a decent cut. It took a little longer than normal but they are students and learning so you have to take that into consideration. Maybe he'll go again, maybe he won't.",-1,0
On a dive bar tour in search of Karaoke on a Friday night....they DON'T have it!  But they do have a rather shady place that I would probably never go in on my own......  After 10 minutes here (we waited for Chris to finish his beer)...we rolled down the road...,-1,0
"I was a little scared...  They had no karaoke.  The crowd was 10 regulars and one was picking scabs off her face...ni lie.   I don't know that I would ever go back or recommend this place, but I am still giving it 3 stars because I am scared...still.",-1,0
"I would give Sweet Tomatoes a 3.5 if I could. I went over Thanksgiving break for lunch and was excited to be back for the first time in a while. Although the layout and options remained the same, the flavor and tastes do not stand out as much as I remember. Now that I am older, I also would like to see more options for any type of protein (I understand it is a salad bar, but salads can come with meat). First though, Sweet tomatoes is great for people who like salads and soups. There are about a dozen different soups and a huge salad bar where you can choose between pre-made salads (Caesar, garden, etc.) and creating your own. There is also a baked potato bar, foccacia breads, muffins, mac and cheese, Alfredo and some pasta. There is a small dessert section that is usually pudding, jello, soft serve, and some fruit. All in all, Sweet tomatoes is a nice place for healthy options, but for those who are looking for more than soup and salad, I would recommend elsewhere.",-1,0
"So I think there are maybe 5 people in Phoenix who have never been to a Sweet Tomatoes or Soup Plantation. Therefore, this review is a little ridiculous; however, I continue to write and you continue to read so here we go.    This restaurant is a chain that gives people the illusion of healthy offerings, when really there is little to nothing healthy about it. The salad bar is good, fresh, and extensive. I really like the caesar salad (not healthy) and the croutons (super not healthy). The rest of the restaurant is comprised of mediocre soups, pastas, and 'pizzas' that aren't anything special, but are very edible. The best item, in my opinion, is the baked sweet potato... can't beat that! Most of the soups are either bland or overly salty, but once in awhile you'll get a good one. The desserts follow the same mediocre trend.... 'brownies,' soft serve, pudding, jello.... meh, nothing amazing, but nothing terrible. Regardless, you'll eat it all... you'll eat it until you are super stuffed and feel sick . Why? It's a buffet! You have to try everything and you have to get your money's worth. Buffet mentality itself is not so healthy.   Anyway, they always offer a coupon and that brings the entire experience to about 10$ without a drink... not terrible. If you are going with a big group, this place has upsides as there are many options and everyone can most likely find something to eat. If you are trying to find a new awesome restaurant to try, maybe for a date.... this probably isn't the place. If you are trying to eat 'healthily' ....My advice... skip the buffet all together.",-1,0
"Come here to fill yourself up with veggies, simple pastas, soups and some soft serve ice cream.  Each location is the same and you can have your food exactly the way you want!",-1,0

"While I am a regular at your various locations, this was the first time I ever tried this one on Ray Rd.  We arrived after shopping, so it was later in the evening.  But, we were not greeted by the cashier in a friendly manner; in fact, she was borderline rude with an attitude.  She acted as if we were a burden.  The food, naturally was good and fresh.  Once we sat down though, the waitress was very friendly and was very accommodating.  I don't think we had a dirty dish on our table for more than 5 mins and the place was packed.  So she really saved the image of this particular establishment/location.",-1,0
"It's a nice clean restaurant with lots of healthy choices. My personal favorite is the fresh broccoli salad.  My ""only issue"" is that it's $31 for two people to eat salad, soup, bread and pasta.  Which is why I am giving it 3 stars and not 4. However, if you like to sample soups, I am a big fan of having a few bites of their various homemade flavors.  Their corn chowder, broccoli soup and chicken pot pie soup was excellent. Knock yourself out with a tasty soup buffet. :)",-1,0
"This is a good location, in terms of freshness. Always a good selection of salad junk, and the soups are good. Avoid their pre-compiled salads, as they basically negate any healthy benefit you might get from eating there. I don't know what's up with the pasta, though -- they've got the worse pasta I've ever tasted. They would do better just to open some cans of Franco-American.  On another downside, this place is kind of ludicrously priced when you think about it. $3 for a drink? It's not a movie theater, man. They do have a discount if you have a Phoenix Zoo membership, so bring your card.",-1,0
"So I have been a sweet tomatoes fan since I was in high school. It definitely has problems, but ever since all of the souper salads around us closed this has really been our only option for a salad buffet.   First off, the prices are really high but they give coupons away like crazy. I get an email pretty much every week, and they are all over the newspapers....just lower the prices already!!! Even with the coupons the price of a meal for a family is much too high for the food that you get, which brings me to my huge problem with the place. Why is there no meat for the salads? Even souper salad had ham and turkey and their prices were much, much lower.   The dessert options are laughable, it's usually oranges and some jello. It reeks of no effort at all and looks sorry. They do offer ice cream but I'm not a fan. Some other options would be appreciated. The service is usually very good and the warm cookies that are brought around are usually delicious.   If Sweet Tomatoes added meat to their menu and lowered the prices, I would be there more often. I don't foresee this happening but it's nice to dream. BTW I am so glad that this place didn't turn into that ""Field Kitchen"" chain that they tried with some other locations. That sounded like a disaster.",-1,0
Sweet tomatoes brings back memories from my childhood because of the buffet line and macaroni and cheese. Lately I have noticed the salads getting more mixed together than usual. The dressings seem to taste more artificial and have a clumpier texture than I remember but I still prefer their house Caesar over a store bought container. The soup selection has not been appealing to me as it did before since the chicken noodle soup is watery and not evenly distributed and the vegetable soups either have too much or too little salt. Their blueberry muffins will always be my favorite dessert option but the never ending ice cream is a close second. Lately the pasta has been a bit more greasy but it still tastes decent. The macaroni and cheese is still made of real cheese and has the best texture. I don't remember if they still serve those cookies but I used to love them when I was younger. I would still come here but only once in a while and only when you get the online coupons for the cheaper meal.,-1,0
"It is what you would expect from a salad bar/buffet, nothing special and nothing terrible. I feel like you are getting a little bit overcharged considering nothing is good except the salad. It has always been clean and never too busy, but not somewhere I would recommend for anything but a salad. I do however, like that is is big and open and that they have outdoor seating.",-1,0
It's nice to find a healthier buffet option. They have plenty of vegetables and other salad toppings to choose from.,-1,0
"Places like this make me realise that I'm not a true animal lover. How can I possibly be if I haven't bought my cat a Bathrobe?  This place sells everything your pet will never really need, but you'll want to spoil them with anyways. It's all really expensive and pretty pointless, but I'm sure an avid pet lover would tell me different.  Probably the most offensive thing in here, which I'm sure you've seen before, is the Ball thrower... and I thought Penicillin was a great invention.

"I had to go to Costco to renew my membership and since I was around the area, I decided to try this place out. If I'm not mistaken, there used to be a Green Grotto at Market Village but I have never tried it.    p.s. I like their little mascot out front TOO CUTE  Anyways, upon entering I was quite amazed by the decor and overall look of the place. It really felt like I was at a cafe. We were seated quite quickly. I don't know why but for some reason I was quite confused eating there. There were no servers at the front of the store so it made me feel like I had to order right at the counter, but the server came to our table so it also felt like I was at like a restaurant?!? I don't know. Kinda threw me me off a little. LIKE DO I RAISE MY HAND ?! DO I WALK TO COUNTER?!   But MOVING ON. WHAT DID I ORDER YOU ASK? WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I ordered a few things to satisfy my hunger:   1. Fuji Apple Iced Tea - surprisingly very good - not too sweet, not too bland - too much ice though   2. White Chocolate Blueberry Cheesecake  - pretty good - not really fresh though but didn't taste stale  - and too sweet for my liking  - presentation is good   3. Sausage and Minced Pork on Rice with Egg - mediocre  - too salty  - had better ones - minced pork isn't minced enough   SO YEAH, menu wise I do wish they had more food options. Not just desserts and drinks. I felt like I was a bit forced to choose the sausage & minced pork rice since the other food options didn't really appeal to me that much. Other than that, their stuff ain't bad. Expensive, but it ain't bad tasting and HEY THEY CAME WITH COMPLIMENTARY POPCORN WHICH DESERVES A HELLLL YEAH because I was craving popcorn and the craving was satisfied. ( They also gave me quite a lot too .. oh yeah baby; however I do think it's a bit too salty)   OVERALL OKAY PLACE BUT THERE ARE BETTER PLACES SO YEAH   oh and I don't know why .. but all of my orders came pretty fast and it was quite busy too SO IDK BOUT OTHERS BUT YEAHSHHA  p.s.s. they should hire more ppl or get the guys do help that one poor girl (which actually happens to be one of my high school classmates LOOL) out .. like literally she was the only one taking orders, getting bills and so on.   p.s.s.s. i caught an abra and weedle here woo....",-1,0

"Overall, 2.5 stars.   Initially, I didn't understand the low rating of this Green Grotto location.  The location, the decoration, the size of the premise, even the quantity of electric outlets didn't strike me as below average.  I thought might be people expect more sofas?  Then I found a reason for which I would give this location a lower rating.  It took a long, long, l-o-n-g time for the beverages to be ready.  The place wasn't busy; there were only 3 tables including ours.  We ordered 3 beverages.  One came within 10 minutes.  The second one took another 10 minutes.  The third one didn't show for a long time, as if it was forgotten.  I saw another table was served.  A take out order was served.  Ours was nowhere.  I waved the waitress.  She acknowledged.  Then magically, she gave us the last beverage in 2 minutes.  It was warm, not hot.  Yeah, it might have really been forgotten.  All the beverages tasted satisfactory.",-1,0
I see why they built this place here. There is a high school nearby.  Love the fresh popcorn. Its even better than movie theater popcorn.   Looked over the menu and really didn't know what to get. Not all items on the menu have a picture of the food but I assume that if there is a picture of that item then it must be one of the better things on the menu. So I went with the sugar cane + milk + grass jelly. Also tried the taro slushie drink. Both drinks were good.  Also tried a dessert which had hot grass jelly + taro + sweet potato + tapioca. Tasted okay.  Service was good considering there was a constant flow of highschoolers.   I think the best part was the fresh popcorn.,-1,0
"Bubble tea is alright I always order the passion fruit one. Drinks are too sweet so order half sugar!  The Oreo bubble tea was better than expected,I'd recommend that speciality tea! I had the green onion pancake and it was horrible, was flaky and not in a good way it made a mess all over the table and my clothes! I couldn't even cut the pancake with a knife! On a lighter note interior is classy and service is nice!",-1,0
"Free Fresh Popcorn +0.5 star  I think there is confusion with the set up with this Green Grotto Tea Room compares to others.   I walked in on a Tuesday afternoon before the High School Students in the area arrive, so the place was empty. There was no one greeting me or anyone in the dining room area to tell me should I have a seat or should I order at the cash at the front area?  Apparently, they have a 15% off for takeout order and if you choose the dine in option, you won't get the discount but you will have your buckets of popcorn.  Hot Formosa Bowl ($6.99) looks so good and pretty in the menu. But when the waitress served that to me this huge bowl of black muddy thing, I almost want to say I did not order that!! Portion is huge with no complaints but the jello was a little hard not silky but I do love those black QQ balls, so chewy.  Munching on popcorn and reading magazines and right at 3:30 pm, 10 High School Students came in and all tables ordered the same bowl, so I guess it is quite popular.  Will I be back? Maybe. As there is not many other options in the immediate area. I will probably stay away from ordering ""real"" food as there is more a ""fast"" food place.",-1,0
"I get take out bubble tea from here since it's the closest bubble tea to my place and they offer 15% off.   Their Hokkaido milk tea (with mixed tapioca) is the only thing you should get!  The only problem is they're slow. There was no one in the store and just two drinks I wanted, and it took them a long while to make. Will be calling ahead from now on to order so it's ready when I pick up.",-1,0
"Pro's: * Location! * Terrace rooms * Friendly & accommodating staff * Luggage storage  Con's: * The AC is controlled by the front desk, so if you take a hot shower on a warm day you will bake in your room. * The wifi is spotty.

"It's a very basic hotel. If you want a place to shower and sleep, this is it.  If hanging out in a hotel is your thing, don't stay here.  It's in a good location. It's also MUCH closer to Mont Royal than Sherbrooke metro station.",-1,0
"Funny name. Too bad this place didn't have a little more character to match that. But it's still cute.  Small boutique/bed and breakfast-style hotel. Rooms are quite small, but most have access to outdoor balconies. Ours had a hammock which we enjoyed on a beautiful summer day! The bathroom was small, but really, how much time are you going to spend in the bathroom during your stay? We were barely in there, because it was our first time in Montreal and we wanted to go explore. Good for the price and in a great area! Just steps away from excellent shopping and restaurants. One of your best bets for the area and price.",-1,0
"Location is PERFECT.  We pretty much walked everywhere, and when we couldn't, we drove which was super easy in and out.  The room itself was clean, but pretty small.  It was overlooking a jazz bar which was playing pretty loud music until 3am, but I brought some earplugs and was fine.  The rooms have a Murphy Bed, so when you put it back up, it does give you a bit more room. They give you free bottled water, OJ, wifi access and croissants in the morning.  Everyone was exceptionally friendly, check in was easy and again, talk about location. I am a bit annoyed that I paid over $100 to stay here considering the size of the room.  I've stayed at the Hotel St-Denis which is bigger, and costs less.  That would be my only complaint, but I think that considering all else, made me feel a little bit better.",-1,0
"It's yet another PT's. And it's one of those PT's that is in a strip mall. Inside, it's like most every other PT's - shocking, I know.   The bar area is large. There are only a couple of bar tops off to one side of the bar - and it is usually way too crowded to even want to sit at one of them, as people will be constantly bumping into you. But it is nice that the bar are is so large, making it easier to snag a bar stool and play some video poker.  Down front is a slightly lower level with several couches and assorted games. This is the area where the karaoke happens. It's actually one of the better PT's for karaoke, as the space / area is large and open - much more accommodating for karaoke.",-1,0
"afaik, south of steeles, there's nowhere else to get sushi/sashimi on a floating boat. fune is unique in this sense.   the setting is quiet and classy, but not stuffy. the servers are friendly. the fish is fresh and there is a decent variety of it. it'd be a pretty good place for a first date imo.  the above doesn't come free however. as many yelpers have already pointed out, fune is more expensive than other establishments. so if quality sushi/sashimi is your top priority, move on. you're get better and more somewhere else. for top quality sushi/sashimi without flourish, i would recommend kaji, yasu or japango.",-1,0
"It's not the best sushi on the planet, but it's certainly not the worst either. Not by far.  Downtown, there are only a handful of decent places and I suppose Fune is one of them.  But the real reason anyone goes is that the sushi bar is surrounded by a river, and you get served on a series of wooden boats chained together and floating on the river.  And THAT is some coolness right there. Best for a family or if you have kids or people who have never tried sushi cause ""raw fish is gross"" with you.  The service is pretty decent too.",-1,0
"Food is good but very pricey!    This Toronto Japanese restaurant offers a variety of items on their menu including hot items.  But what will catch your attention is the sushi is served on little floating boats that circle the sushi bar and you can grab what you like.  The only problem that I had was that all of their plates were all the higher priced plates floating around even though they had different items, Fune's prices are pretty high for what they offer on that little plate.    I ended getting a don because I didn't want to continuously grab plates from the floating boats because I knew I was already adding up my tab instantaneously.  Go in for the experience, but don't expect to get full unless you break your bank a little bit.",-1,0

One gross family came in, daughter (age 10ish) started grabbing at plates before hand towels came, and then she PUT IT BACK after taking the lid off.  Gross, gross, gross. It never occurred to me that this could happen, and nobody was monitoring.  Sick!",-1,0
"Sushi, on BOATS! :) The novelty is fun, but sushi wise, its pretty standard. Was seated right away at 6:15 at the sushi bar, and things filled up quickly.  Prices are pretty high (as mentioned by everyone), but is a neat place to bring a date. Kinda fun for conversation and such.  Sushi and service were pretty standard. Pretty slow on the drink refills.  Note: They do NOT take debit. What places dont take debit? AmEx i can see, but no debit? Ugh.  All in all, there are 100 other sushi places with cheaper and better sushi.",-1,0
"Pro: Sushi floating in bloats around a large table is a cool experience. Worth a try, but will not return.  Con: Overpriced. Not Japanese owned and operated. AYCE sushi places are way better compared to this place.",-1,0
"Finally got to try this rotating sushi bar downtown and it was a pretty cool experience. If you are hungry or looking for value for your money, don't come here because you will end up racking up a hefty bill since you are just grabbing things off the conveyer belt and all plates are different prices. I would say the sushi was pretty fresh just not worth the price per plate. You also have the option of ordering a la carte. We did this because we wanted to make sure we were full rather than eating 2-3 pcs of sushi per plate off the belt. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki and I ordered the nabe udon. The udon really let me down and is what brought down one star for this rating. The broth had no flavour and the presentation of this dish was just horrible. The service was pretty decent and the ambience was really nice, had a modern cozy feel. Overall, this was an experience that I would only try once!",-1,0
"Truly a FUN-e experience. If you have never been to a conveyor belt sushi before you should try it out. Almost all the food I picked from the belt or ordered from the kitchen was great, the uni from the belt albeit one of the priciest items on the belt was not on so very fresh *dum dum dum* otherwise it was fun, waiters were attentive and friendly. They did charge me $1 (CAD dollar) for spicy mayo, really guys? Anyways, this place reminds me that I need to make my way back to Japan or Hong Kong where they conveyor belt sushi selection is much more expansive and I can sit and pick all day and not let it break the bank.  #ccawentures",-1,0
"I did not have the sushi boat experience, but went with the a la carte service.  While the service was great, the food was mediocre.   For that price, I am expecting top notch sushi.  I do give it props for some authentic Japanese dishes that hit the spot!",-1,0
"sushi is fresh as usual, but nothing outstanding. The rolls were good. Good service. I think the catch is the rotating belt, but since it is common in Asia so it's not that attractive to me. The plate decoration was pretty though.",-1,0
"I guess the concept was different, though their food was just alright. Due to their conveyer style dispensation, food was very limited, though you could also order from menu. Their food was decent but not relative to their price.   Service was alright, nothing spectacular nor bad.   Atmosphere was ok, it just looked like a typical Chinese restaurant setup rather a Japanese inspired restaurant. The only section that remotely resembles a Japanese inspired ensemble was the centre piece (conveyer belt).  If you have the money, and was looking to experience, go for it... though it's not that impressionable. On the food side, the food was decent.",-1,0
"After passing this this Japanese food stalwart for years, I had lunch here for the first time.  We didn't do that boats (which rotate on a moving tram), but just ate at the tables on the side.  I had a sashimi lunch special.  For $14, it was 15 pieces of assorted sashimi with salad, soup and rice.  The fish was the standard assortment (salmon, tuna, white fish, surf calms, octopus).  Honestly, it was fine, but nothing special.  In fact, it was kinda unmarkable in all respects, but I can't fault it for anything either.  I would say the service was better than at most Japanese restaurants.  We always had water and they left us with the pot of green tea.    Bottom-line is that it's standard Japanese food in a good location with decent service  and slightly elevated prices.",-1,0
I came here based on a strong recommendation and found it rather typical or maybe tired. The sushi was fine; sashimi fresh but nothing very inspirational. Good sake list.,-1,0
"I always passed by this area thinking about trying it. And now I got the chance for a b-day for a friend. We ate right at the sushi bar where there was a conveyor belt in a boat circling small plate samples from nigiri, sashimi, rolls at different price points from $3.5 to $7 per plate. Its all small snack size, and some are good, some are average.  We also got a salmon bento box priced at a whopping $24. The food portion is not too average considering our normal to big appetite. For 3 plates off the boat conveyor and the bento box, its a whopping $70! This place is definitely a one and done place for me.",-1,0
"Average sushi (from the train), stern/unfriendly but prompt service.  Sat down at the sushi train part of the restaurant (there is also a normal sit down section where you order from the menu). Variety of rolls and sashimi are lacking.  Also a bit expensive ($7 for 2 pieces of what looked to be white tuna nigiri, although didn't taste like it so I have no idea what that was?).  Some of the dishes were on the train the entire time I was sitting there, so freshness may be in question (although what I got tasted okay.)  Due to the lack of variety, I ordered the agedashi tofu off the menu, which was good (though hard to mess up).  Service was a bit abrupt bordering unfriendly, but efficient.",-1,0
"I don't eat fish. Frankly I am one of the few Maritimers who don't. So why should you read this review? Well what I don't like about fish is the fishiness - the smell of it and the fishy taste. As a newly converted sushi eater, if I detect fishiness, vroom vroom I am out of there. Good news for Fune. Nothing fishy about this unue joint. Place was full for a business lunch so we ended up at bar. My colleague was skeptical as her first Fune experience wasn't great, but it was at a table. The green tea was a bit non descript but the boatloads, literally, of sushi were amusing and quite fresh. Fune is noisy but side by side, we could talk OK. We tried lots of red belly tuna, some yummy light tempura, decent miso soup, and these cool little doughballs with kiwi jam in the centre. I liked the kiwi but my colleague did not. In short, when you read the reviews, its hit and miss here. We hit.",-1,0
"Wonderful place at a price. Food is great, atmosphere is there, but only thing missing is a view.",-1,0
"Come here once for the novelty of the sushi-belt boats. Bring a camera too!  If you decide to come again, you might want to order off the menu.   The items in the boats are expensive (based on quantity and freshness). Some items taste like it's been there all day.   Stuff from the menu is expensive too, but since it hasn't been sitting on a plate circling around a sushi chef all day, it's fresh. Quite tasty too.",-1,0
"When you go to Fune, you're definitely going for the novelty and experience versus the food.  I've walked by this restaurant many times and ended up going on a whim with a friend of mine.  We sat at the sushi bar and were mesmerized as the boats floated by us with a good variety of different sushi and sashimi options.  They have a dinner menu as well, but we decided to stick with the boat buffet.  Each item is on a specifically designed plate as to denote the price of each dish.  They ranged from approximately $3.50-$6.00 per plate, so it's best to pay attention because you can rack up a hefty bill fairly quickly.  As time went on, the chefs would switch it up and put new items on the boats.  We stayed for a bit as to not miss out on anything.  The plates are also all covered so it's a bit difficult to see what was inside so I found myself staring at the boats very intensely as they passed me  I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I know that I have had better.  The sushi was good, but definitely not worth the price tag.  Because the sushi sits on the boats until someone picks them up, some of the sashimi had dried a bit.  The rolls and maki could have used a bit more seasoning as well.  However I did enjoy my time there.  The atmosphere is very intimate and the staff were readily available to help out.  There were a couple times that I picked up a plate only to realize I didn't want it, but the boat had floated by and I couldn't put it back.  The staff noticed and kindly took the plate away.  I'm very glad I finally went to Fune, and I'll probably go again, but it would have to be for a special occasion.  The novelty is definitely worth it.  I might have to reconsider bringing my boyfriend though.  With only 2-3 pieces on each plate, his bill might come up to $1000!",-1,0
"Since the demise of Sushi Train a few years ago Fune is the only place in Toronto I know of that has conveyor belt delivered sushi.   The staff at Fune are actually Japanese (if you care about such things).  In Japan conveyor belt sushi places are usually quite cheap - cheaper than regular sushi restaurants (you don't need to pay waitstaff to take orders, bring the food etc. so it's kind of like fast food sushi), but I think because it's very novel over here the converse is true.  Having been a regular at the dearly departed Sushi Train I'd have to say that Fune while decent, is not as good.  The sushi on the boats is priced per plate, the different colours of the plates indicates the price.  The first problem is just that there are I think 7 or 8 different prices  based on the different plate designs so a blue plate with white dots costs one amount but a white plate with blue dots cost a different amount, and it's really difficult to remember what prices the 7 or 8 colours mean.   In order to find out the price of each plate you have to wait till the price guide plates come around at the end of the conveyor which takes a few minutes, and hope you remember it as all the food goes by, so you basically have no way of knowing what everything costs since it's really confusing.  I resorted to taking a few pictures of the price plates with my phone, but then having to pull out the pictures and sort through them as the food sailed by wasn't ideal either.  They should just put something up on the wall or in the menu that people can refer to, or have fewer price points.   The sushi is also pretty expensive, with plates going up to $6.50 (e.g. for three pieces of salmon sashimi) it's near the financial district and the decor and furnishings are all very upscale so I can understand the price is going to be higher, but still for me the price isn't really justified.  The Sushi is good, but it's not amazing.   Sushi train also had a very cool feature where each booth had a hot water faucet built into it so you could make yourself unlimited amounts of tea.  I know that doesn't have anything to do with Fune, but hey if you want to extend the do it yourself thing it was pretty cool, and it isn't present at Fune.",-1,0
"I came here and sat in the main portion of the restaurant so I cannot comment on the conveyor belt experience. The staff were very attentive and the food was good, though overpriced. I had the torikaraage, avacado and cucumber roll and almond cheesecake.",-1,0
"Fune is like visiting a familiar and comfy old home. Err - or maybe that's just on account of my being here at least 1-3 times per week for lunch.  I love watching the hypnotizing miniature wooden boats float by on the ""sushi-go-round"" moat.  It somehow makes it a lot less awkward in dining alone, like staring at a TV screen with only one channel/the fireplace channel. Aww yeaaaah, I would totally subscribe to that one.   The sushi quality is a bit higher than AYCE.  Here, the glistening slabs of fish are cut a little thicker, the sashimi is served atop a shiso leaf, and pieces aren't like a car tire of rice the way AYCE places roll them out (pun intended, oh thilly, thilly Rando). But a certain other sushi joint close by has ruined all other sushi joints in Toronto for me, and I now expect no less than to be given a piece-by-piece served straight from the chef's cutting board to a plate in front of me.  I mean, all the sushi sitting on one singular plate at once? What am I, a peasant?! Pfft.   Bratty kidding aside, the pricing here is reasonable for the area. For example, an order of ika sashimi is $10 as opposed to a much stingier portion for about $15 at a neighbouring sushi place. I recommend to skip the greasy, heavy-battered tempura and try the nabeyaki udon instead. Broth sweetened by the nappa cabbage, my tip is to eat the scallop before it turns rubbery...",-1,0
"Overall I'd have to rate my visit a 3.5/5  My friends and I came here after school one day at around 6pm on a Wednesday. It wasn't that busy so we got to choose a nice spot by the rotating sushi. The service was good and we were handed hot towels almost immediately.  The restaurant was nicely decorated and had a bit of a ""rich people"" vibe, since the only few people who were there were dressed professionally (compared to us students who were showing up in casual clothes and backpacks). I loved how the sushi was floating on little boats on top of water! That was super duper cute, and we got to see them make the sushi as well so that's another thing I enjoyed.  The colour of the plates indicated how much each of the dishes costed. It's a little hard to remember, but we had fun with it by making a little game to see who would remember the prices correctly. Prices range from $3-$7 per plate.  The sushi was pretty good and there was an okay amount of variety. The thing is, me and my friends were more concerned about how the cost of food would add up, rather than enjoying everything to the fullest. You don't know how many times I held myself back from grabbing the sashimi because it was one of the more expensive dishes. We didn't end up eating that much, but we still had to pay quite a lot.   If you're a poor student like me, you'd probably be better off just going to an AYCE sushi place. That way you'd be able to eat a lot more, have a greater variety, and not have to spend as much. However, it was a really good experience! I'd love to visit again sometime, but definitely not anytime soon. Gotta let my wallet recover first!",-1,0
"Come here for business lunch frequently. Sushi bar is decent good flavor, lacks variety.",-1,0
"Came here last night and it wasn't very busy. I made reservations for the sushi bar as I thought the revolving sushi would be a fun experience for my mom and I. This is the only restaurant in Toronto that has revolving sushi bar.   Friendly service and overall quite attentive. When eating at the sushi bar you can grab whatever plate you want on the boats and there are different colour plates, the prices range from $3.00 - $7.00 so it can get expensive if you have a big appetite. You can also order off the dinner menu, they have a selection of appetizers, sushi, rolls and noodles.   Grabbed a bunch of plates from the sushi bar from salmon sashimi to mochi. We ordered off the menu and we got the following: Beef Soba, Mountain Roll and Fresh Oysters.   Overall, the bill cost $100 including taxes and tips plus a pint of Sapporo and glass of wine. It was a fun experience to have at least once but there are definitely other sushi places that offer better quality in sushi and food in general.",-1,0
"Sushi was OK but should be better for this price level. I ate here for lunch (when I couldn't get into my favourite sushi restaurant - Yuzu around the corner). Being a big eater, the colour coded dishes started to add up with a surprise a bill time :). I tried many things but not sure what they were called as you help yourself. Service was average.  Didn't try any of the entrees so can't comment on them.",-1,0
"Went here for a team lunch.  I haven't been hear for years so I forgot whether I liked it or not.  So I ordered my benchmark dish ""chirashi don""  The dish came with miso soup which was pretty much standard.  It also came with a salad and they used something like sesame seed dressing and the sauce was very fragrant so I really liked it.  The main entree arrived and the mix of the ingredients was mostly good (I say mostly because it used the cheap fake crab).  However, overall it is still quite good.  Unfortunately, I have had better up north where parking is free.  The price at Fune is quite high as well.  As such, so I can't add this to my ""reasons to go downtown"" list.  You also don't get dessert, so I ended up going to the Crepes a gogo booth at Metro Hall after the meal.",-1,0
I've eaten here twice and enjoy the food and the service. I don't think I'd go back again. Neither the food nor service warrants the price. Missed it by that much.,-1,0
Sushi on Conveyor belts are so fun!  The sushi is fresh and the rice is quite flavorful but what a kick of surprise to have wasabi spread under the sushi to stick it to the rice. Is that the traditional style of sushi? I've not had it this style.   Pricing is not too terrible but is on the higher side. I guess that is the way sushi cost crumbles.  The service is very nice. They are attentative and try to explain everything. Our waitress tried her best to find out the name of one of the fish for us because she only knew the name in Japanese. That was nice of her. I could have had more water refills but it was a nice time anyway.,-1,0
Burgers only are a great idea. Ask for bottled anything. Drinking from a glass or eating off a glass plate looks risky so great idea that they have disposable plates/paper instead. The 3 stars are because the flavor of burger was decent and the staff was decent and adorable. Just pray over their dishwashing machine! Whew...,-1,0
"Walked in around 9-9:30 at night, they didn't close until 11. My family(of 7) stood in the front for a good 7-8 minutes. They were not in the least bit busy and multiple people looked our way and ignored us before someone FINALLY came over to greet us. When we got to our table, a guy took our drink orders and whatnot and told us our server would be over shortly. The server took a while to come by and throughout the entire visit we got very slow service, which didn't make sense seeing as how there were maybe four full tables in the entire restaurant. I'm giving this three stars bc my family thoroughly enjoyed our food and shakes. I was disappointed, seeing as how I hardly go here, I remember why I choose other places to eat.",-1,0

"3 PM on a sweltering hot day.  When I lived in Connecticut (4 years ago), there was a Red Robin in the Boston Post mall.   The motif was a 50s diner and similar menu.  Relatively cheap burgers.  That's what I was expecting as I walked toward the door.    What I found was a fairly upscale bar that happens to serve institutional food.  I ordered the ""Arctic Cod"" fish and chips with the Orange cream Soda.  The cod were overcooked and tasteless - closer to fish sticks.  The plastic container basket seemed designed to cool food as quickly as possible and awkward to use.  I neither asked for more steak fries or a refill  The music playing was annoying, along with the sports on the TV.  Most people would probably consider that a plus.  The waiter explained to me that the chain in CT was a different company.  That's not true.  They reimagined themselves to not tcompete against Steak & Shake or 5 guys, which was what I was hoping to find",-1,0
"This was my first visit to any Red Robin, so my review is limited to a first impression. I visited in July, 2017 at around 6:00 PM. I sat at the bar an ordered a traditional cheeseburger with American cheese and bacon at a medium temperature.  The bartender was very nice and made a few beer suggestions. I settled on a draft Pabst Blue Ribbon. The beer was cold and the burger was super good and extremely filling. I would return, and would also recommend the Red Robin to anyone.",-1,0
"On this visit, we were going so that David could get his free birthday burger.  The service on this visit was the worst we've ever experienced here.  Usually, this location of RR is fast, friendly and effecient. However, today they seemed to be understaffed and overwelmed.    When they brought our plates out, there were no fries on them.  We had finished almost half of our sandwiches before the fries finally made it out.   However, whent they finally appeared, the fries were fresh and hot... and my chicken teriakyi sandwhich (with lettuce, tomato, grilled pineapple and swiss cheese) was good.   A couple of negatives about the place, they have several tiny two seater booths that just do not have enough table space. Also, I wish they would serve the sandwiches on a plate rather than in the baskets that they normally use.    The place is very family-friendly and normally a good place to visit for a fast casual meal.",-1,0
"Must preface this review with the fact this was my third visit and none of the previous visits deserved a review...good or bad. Chatty staff, below average food and noisy environ undeserving! Until now; the Smoke & Pepper Signature Burger is a dam fine burger but let's first note the Tower of Onion Rings which are memorable. Dipping sauces not so much but they don't need any help. And remember to save one of those rings for your burger.   Ordered my S&P medium with crisp bacon which was grilled to perfection! I added that remaining ring for additional crunch...delicious!  The fries are similar to the ring dipping sauce...forgettable! Surprising considering they're target market is the burger segment.   Almost felt like a grown up burger joint!

"Ordered the $15 deal for two tavern burgers, fries and an appetizer.  Burgers were decent, almost no fries in either box seems like if you dine in and they are unlimited they should put more in the box on a to go order.

This deal was a better value than ordering off the menu as their prices strike me as high for a burger and fries for the most part.",-1,0
"I was watching my 3 y/o nephew on Saturday and I told him we could go out for lunch. At first he said he wanted a bagel for lunch, so visions of Poppyseeds started dancing in my head. But by the time we were ready to go the fickle kid decided nope, he wants a cheeseburger!   I tried to go to Big Daddy's but there was a 20 minute wait and the little guy said let's go somewhere else. I remembered seeing Red Robin further down the road so we went there and thankfully were sat right away. I got my nephew a kids cheeseburger and even with all the options for sides he wanted apple slices. I got the chicken caprese sandwich.   The food came fast, which is good with kids. I wanted a burger but knew I'd be better off with the chicken, so I tried a bite of the kids and it was really good. My sandwich was good too, basically grilled chicken on a soft ciabatta bun, with lettuce, balsamic marinated tomatoes and surprisingly good fresh mozzarella. I asked for the pesto aioli on the side. It came with the steak fries but I only ate 3 of them. Not a big fan of these wish they were crisper.   All in all a pretty good experience and definitely reasonably priced.",-1,0

There was only one employee at the counter but at least 6 others walking around. Then to top it off I chose a seat where there would be an empty seat on both sides of me to find out someone moved 2 seats over and i was sitting in a man's seat that went to the concession stand.   The movie was great but would have been better also if the man would have quit checking his phone.,-1,0
"This is still my theater of choice, but all the changes has made slow service even slower. I hope someday they figure out a way to move a line quickly. The chairs are comfy, tho.",-1,0
"Didn't know what's good to eat at the LINQ, so we picked this place.  The service is okay.  The seating are kinda small, so we decided to sit at the lounge.  The waiter we got was okay also. We ordered the pulled pork entree, fried chicken meal, and a milkshake (overflow/messy around the glass).  The fried chicken won.  Tasted a lot better than the pull pork.  The portion was okay.  Spent $60 for two..not really worth it here. Music here was blasting  and this place does get pretty busy at times.  Try it once and that's it.",-1,0
"I just want to say upfront that the staff was really cool.  The Strip can be sort of unfriendly and cold, especially the popular places. There's just an arrogance. I was really impressed how friendly and helpful the Brooklyn Bowl employees were. This is not a budget friendly outing though.  Food in the restaurant looked good and sounded good but it is on the pricey side. 20+ bucks for a fried chicken dinner (which I'm certain is very delicious). Drinks are overpriced just like the rest of the Strip. This is also a very difficult concert venue for people who are handicapped or have disabilities.  Brooklyn Bowl earnestly attempts to accommodate those people who have challenges getting around following ADA guidelines. But its not a good place if you have any physical limitations The concert venue has a cordoned off area for disabled people.  Sadly, there are those people who lie and say they are disabled to get in this area. It is cramped, over crowded and I believe not safe.  The general ""seating"" of the BB concert venue is STANDING room only for the most part.  The disabled section has seating and is in a really good location for seeing the stage. So people lie about being disabled to get in this area.  How do I know?  A few of them told me. They thought it was cool to pull off the scam. Typical Las Vegas mentality - Immature, ill mannered and selfish. Glad I went though.  Finally got to experience the Brooklyn Bowl.  Just won't be going back.",-1,0
"I wasn't impressed with the food. I ordered the hamburger, which was overcooked and flavorless. These days there are a lot of great burgers out there and if I'm going to pay $16 for one, I expect it to be GOOD. That being said, it's a cool environment with live music and fun vibe.",-1,0
"The atmosphere and the concept of the place was great but let me start by saying some of their employees need a lesson in customer service.  We wanted to eat & bowl but they charge you by the half hour and the half hour starts as soon as you get your lane. So we decided to eat first, I ordered the chicken platter & let me say it was nothing like what they say on their website, Ive def. had better fried chicken & their cole slaw was so bland and gross. I will say the mashed potatoes and gravy was good but It def. wasn't worth a 20$ meal.  After we ate we decided to bowl, let me remind you they start the time as soon as they give you your lane, you cant bowl until you get your shoes which they bring to your table and let me note you still have to find your size ball so by the time you even get to bowl 5-8mins have passed. There was 6 in our party, we made it to the 5th before we had to get another half hour. They def. know how to get you on your money. They def. have room to grow but for now it def. wasn't what i expected.",-1,0
"The venue is kick-ass for music or bowling but the food wasn't that great-maybe our expectations were set too high (a ton of hype about the food). We had the pork rinds (super salty), fried chicken (bland) and mac 'n cheese (plain, also bland). We're leaving less than satisfied but happy to finally see the joint.  Nice staff, decent service, best thing about it is the ambiance. We won't come back unless there's an awesome show.",-1,0
"Brooklyn Bowl is definitely a spot one should check out while at the Linq.  The place is has many televisions throughout the establishment,  however you will not be able to hear them due to the loud rock music playing .       The service is great there and they are friendly .  My only complaint towards this established is their food.  I  was not overly impressed with their food or menu.  Nothing seemed to grab my attention.  However, the best thing on the menu was the Nutella Shake for $10.00.  Overall, this place is one everyone should visit to grab a drink before bowling.",-1,0
"3.5. Actually.  Service was young. Sweet, but... kinda...Ya know. And the food was almost spot on - guacamole perfection,  flutas  (sping? ) drowned but tasty. Now... the drinks are amazing. Atmosphere is where I was lost, loud and bustling= felt like a airport bar. Go on a week night maybe for a not so cafeteria loud experience? Great for a group though! :') not the best Mexican in the city, but the drinks saved the night!",-1,0
"Holy heart burn!! Warning label should be on the hot sauce. Ordered the short rib tacos and the "" famous tacos of Mexico"" The short rib tacos were very tasty put extremely oily and the pork tacos were pretty plain but the pork was good quality and cooked very well. I was checking out what other people were ordering and everything looked pretty good. I think I will need to try a few more things on the menu before I give up on this place. The ambience and service was exceptional.",-1,0
"When eating tacos, I like to have a good hot sauce on the side. Cantina definitely delivered in this respect. On the table, there are two hot sauces, the red one, chipotle based, and the green one, SPICY!   We ordered the octopus taco, fish taco and the LA truck taco. The combination of flavors worked very well. Each was enjoyable but the octopus was particularly good. I'm not sure how they cook it, but it was soft and flavorful. We also have the ceveche and plated chorizo burrito. The ceveche was not what I expected; I could have used some more salt and lime. The burrito was quite good, and unique. It had a fried egg on top, along with many sauces.   The reason for 3-star rating is mainly because of the price. With so many other fusion taco places around now, changing $5+ for a taco seems to be a bit steep.",-1,0
"Went here last night at the suggestion of a friend. We ordered the halibut ceviche that came out with baked nacho chips that were delicious and sadly, the highlight of this dish. I was surprised by how many chips they gave us compared to the tiny amount of ceviche that was presented.   We ordered 3 tacos, out of the 3 the one that stands out the most to me was the grilled octopus taco with the chorizo. The octopus was tender and the toppings added lots of delicious flavour and texture. Second would be the kalbi beef taco that was not as good as the octopus but a close second. Again, lots of toppings that added a good mix of flavour and texture. Unfortunately the halibut fish taco paled in comparison to the first 2 so I would recommend skipping it. As an entree we ordered the enchiladas. It comes with 2 so it's good to share with one other person. It wasn't bad but also nothing special.    Upon leaving, I noticed another menu that was placed in the window. I was a little confused as to why we didn't receive this seafood menu as well as the normal menu because it had many appealing seafood choices like oysters on the half shell.  I'd recommend checking it out if you are in the area and craving some Mexican but I wouldn't travel just to try this place.",-1,0
"Food and service is so inconsistent, it's frustrating. They need to work that out because I feel like I'm playing Russian roulette every time I go into this place.",-1,0
"Playa Cabana Cantina was packed when we went for dinner. The food was good, even borderline great because it's difficult to find authentic Mexican food in Toronto. I recommend the chicken tinga which is a chipotle and tomato based pulled chicken dish served in tacos, enchiladas or a burrito. The tortillas used for the tacos had been fried so they were a little bit crispy which was nice.   The service was passable but we certainly didn't feel like they were happy to have us in their restaurant. Normally I would expect recommendations of which dishes are popular and daily specials. Our server made us feel like she was doing us a favour by serving us as she didn't think to come and ask us how our food was until we were almost done, then we had to flag her down to order more food. We were not offered hot sauce and figured they probably didn't have any until we saw some on other tables as we were leaving. Granted, they were quite busy.   Prices were a bit high for what they serve and the portion sizes however I think they're mostly justified given the quality and taste of the food - except for the dessert. We paid $10 for a pastel tres leches which was little more than a small slice of glorified pound cake with a scoop of ice cream. I lived in Mexico City for five years and am familiar with what a good pastel tres leches should be. This was not it. Perhaps we should have tried the churros poutine which looked great.   I would definitely go back to Playa Cabana Cantina, perhaps for lunch instead of dinner to enjoy a less hectic atmosphere. The food was enjoyable and I'd like to try more of their menu. With better service I would feel more comfortable paying these prices for tacos.",-1,0
"I really want to like this restaurant as I live in the area, but the service is lacking.   The food is top notch, but the two times I have been there (once on a Tuesday over dinner, and once on a Saturday afternoon ) the service has been horrible. Staff are friendly enough, but on both occasions the wait staff didn't even know who was supposed to serve us.  Tables on either side of ours,  who arrived after us, were served before us.  I'd love to see these guys succeed, but when they can't even serve us in a timely manner, the neighborhood may be better off without them.",-1,0
"Had really great fish tacos among many other dishes.  The wait staff was very nice and helpful.  My only beef is that the prices are a little too high for what you're getting.  That said, if money isn't an issue, go for it.",-1,0
"I'd been waiting a long time to eat here. It's so busy at dinner that we could never get in when we dropped by so we came for lunch last Saturday. We were greeted and seated right away and the prompt service cont'd. That was a plus. We ordered the guacamole to start. This was served with a generous portion of fresh corn chips. This was big for two and would be just the right size app for three. As it turned out this was the highlight of the meal (at least for me). My friend had the crispy shrimp tacos and loved them. I had the fish burrito and was disappointed. It was bland and filled with more  rice than anything. It was also seved like a snack you'd eat with your hands but drizzled with a crema sauce that made that idea messy and near impossible. I ate half my burrito and traded the rest for one of my friends shrimp tacos which I thought were pretty good (better than my choice) but not great.  For the price and the rave reviews, I expected a lot better. The location and service was great and because my dining companion loved his meal, I'm giving three stars. I would try it again at some point just for the excellent guac and chips and to see if some of the other menu options are any better than the burrito.",-1,0
Ordered from this place for the first time. Wasn't bad but could be better. A bit greasy for my taste and lacked seasoning. Chips were good but some were overly salted than others. Tacos are overpriced and the chips and guacamole considering lack of spices. I did enjoy the crunch of he slaw!,-1,0
"I've only been here once for dinner on a Friday night and I enjoyed it! The place was packed (there were no reservations left when I called, but I was told I could walk-in). I didn't have to wait long before finding a seat at the bar - our waiter even helped us move to a better location once his other patrons left.  The food was good - really tasty and the portions were perfect for me. The only thing that wasn't so good was that it took a long time to get our pitcher of mojito...and there wasn't a lot of alcohol in it :( There was just too much ice in that pitcher.  But I do like the food and the decor!",-1,0
"If you are into $6 tacos, you will probably love this place!  Had lunch here with a friend over the weekend. Place was empty at lunch and service was therefore great as there were only 3 other tables of diners.   I tried an ensalada picada (chopped salad with lots of ingredients, $9) and 1 taco (the pulled pork, $6). Both were tasty and I enjoyed them. If you want to feel full you would need to order at least twice of that, but since I was having Thanksgiving dinner later in the day, I didn't mind a light meal.  I could see this place being an excellent dinner spot, but think they should have a special lunch menu, because who wants to spend $40 on lunch?",-1,0
"Service:  Contrary to many of the other reviews, I found the service here pleasant.  Yeah, sure, all of the servers are in their 20s, but there was only 1 try-hard who, fortunately, was not my server.  He was just entertaining to watch as he seemed to do more dancing than actual work.  My server was very knowledgeable and even managed to ""up-sell"" on an app!  (Good job, btw.)  Eventually, he did hafta kick us out of our table, but did so in a gentle way, saying that we can stay as long as we wanted, if we moved to the bar area.  Food:  The best thing I tasted was probably the guacamole.  I know how to make a mean guac, but this one had a particular spice in it that added a nice kick!  Other food we ordered were veg burrito and fish tacos.  Even though everything is made on site, as per the server, and tasted fresh, I found it to be on the bland side.  (And I'm not someone who adds salt to prepared food!)  The tortilla chips, burrito, and fish tacos lacked flavour in the way of salt.  It's definitely edible, but again, fresh but bland - if that makes sense.  Probably a good distraction for what the food lacked was the restoration décor, followed by the vibe.  This place just opened up about a month ago, so it did get busy in this quiet part of city.  Overall, it was good as an experience/for a drink/bite to eat, NOT for a first date or anything 'cause it. is. loud, but I would neither go out of my way to go again nor would I be against visiting again!  Other tips: -  lotsa free street parking, at least for a Thursday evening -  only order a pitcher of mojito if there are 3+ ppl! -  burritos are quite BIG, so share if you can OR take out the rest (but it's also saucy!) -  3 tacos, or at least the fish ones, aren't that filling on its own, so order accordingly -  watch your step when using the washroom downstairs as there is NO railing, a big Health & Safety concern, esp. for drunkies!!!",-1,0
"Service was mediocre and the food was just the same, very small portions for the prices ($16.00 for 3 small fish tacos, no sides included).   We had to wait about 10 - 15 minutes before our drink order was taken and the kicker of the whole evening was when my friend ordered a cappuccino and they served it with salt. We brought it to the server(s) attention and only a small apology was given and a replacement cappuccino, but then they continued to charge her for it on the bill. Lack in customer service!   My rule of thumb and most restaurants I've ever been to, is that if you screw up on something, you replace the item and DO NOT charge the customer. Thanks for that mouthful of salt!   That's the lasting impression this place left with us! And the server had the nerve to be pissy when he didn't receive a fabulous tip, he's lucky he got anything at all!",-1,0
"Delicious spot-on food. The fish taco was sincerely dreamy...TRY IT, you won't regret it! The taco al pastor (sp?) was fine but a tiny bit dry and the Kalbi beef one was moist and flavourful.   Went with a couple friends on a Thursday night - we literally had to yell at each other to be able to converse. Fun place but super loud.",-1,0
Delivious but unreasonably pricey in comparison to the other gourmet taco places toronto has to offer. And they really push their expensive drinks on you too.,-1,0
Updating my review in light of the menu changing again. Happy to see the pablanos and wet burritos (which are amazing btw) have been out back on the menu. Still missing my ceviche and not a huge fan of the tostadas so review still remains low. Kudos though to the restaurant for listening to their customers and bringing some if their great dishes back. :),-1,0
"I went in with two friends in the middle of the afternoon to catch up after all having been away/busy for a few weeks. In the middle of a workday, it's understandable that it's a little slow. Our server seemed totally miserable that she was at work; not quite sure what that was about, she was fine, just not very engaging. It took quite a bit of time to get some chips with salsa (which was great) and guacamole.  We ordered a pitcher of mojitos, which while one of my favourite drinks (when mixed correctly) was horrible. I actually had to take antacids after (and I'm not one to have this issue!)  The menu wasn't huge (but I guess this keeps in the cantina style) and the menu specifies no additions or substitutions. I ordered the chicken taco salad option (the one ""sub"" you're allowed to make instead of having it in the shell) and it was DELICIOUS! perfectly spiced and shredded, wrapped in lettuce. Amazing.   Next time, I'll order my food to go!",-1,0
"busy and with a good vibe.  would have like an option to order three different tacos rather than all the same but understand. We just ordered three different groups of three tacos and shared the plates. The shrimp tacos stood out from our selection.  The appetizer guac was OK, but not worth the $9.",-1,0
"3.5 stars.   In fairness, I didn't get a burger because I was stuffed so I probably suffered from a case of ordering the wrong thing. Lesson learned: don't order a salad at a burger joint. My boyfriend loved his burger, on the other hand, and had the option to add a fried egg. I did notice that the burgers are a little bit on the small side for the price.   There are TONS of beer choices as well. Love that they served pizza-flavored popcorn as a free appetizer. The buffalo chicken dip was amazing and a must-order appetizer (ask for extra chips if you need them).   Again, I probably just ended up ordering the wrong thing (salad with ahi tuna) which was really bland... but worth coming here to try the burgers and shakes.",-1,0
"Average. Burger was fine, but not exceptional. Moderate selection, but nothing inventive... They just throw a couple ""Kobe""s, ""sirloin""s, and ""fried egg""s in to try to make it sound fancy, but at the end of the day it's still just a standard good burger. Fries were sub par. Service wasn't bad but it could have been better.",-1,0
The gold standard was not bad but nothing really memorable about it that would make me want to come back (especially for its price). The fries for some reason that night were absolutely horrible. I love potatoes in all shapes and sizes so I was pretty sad that my steak cut fries were so awful I didn't want to finish them. My friend ordered the sweet potato fries and also mentioned that they were really disgusting and tasted like they had been sitting around for ages.,-1,0
"I think I've decided that Foie Gras on a burge might sound good, but for some reason doesn't taste as delicious as I fantasize it would.  For my first Holsteins experience I had the Billionaire burger with the drunken Monkey shake.  The burger was good.  It was juicy and flavorful, but I kinda wish I didn't have the billionaire burger as the expectation was way too high.  It was still pretty good though.  The shake was amazing.  I could taste all the bananas and Reeses in it...sooo good!!!  So my first experience was pretty good, and I will come back for more...althought it is no Umami Burger.",-1,0
"We bought a Groupon a while a go since I had been wanting to try Holsteins since they opened. We finally got to use it...before it expired, expiration dates are good like that, giving you a kick in the butt. We got soda's and split the Cereal Bowl Adult milkshake....loved it, reminded me of the Captain Crunch shake Carl's Jr. Used to sell.  I ordered the Gold Standard which is not as good as the Lbs. Burger version of the same burger (Perfect burger), it was good just nothing special. The shoe string fries were crispy but I didn't like that they are batter dipped. My husband got the Machete burger again he liked it but it was nothing to write home about....not as good as lbs. Both were cooked well..nice and juicy. Our waitress was great, she answered all our questions, and was patient with our indisiciveness. I wouldn't steer someone away from Holsteins but I would recommend places that I think are better.",-1,0
"It's not the best burger, but it's not the worst burger. I came here for a late lunch and had the Rising Sun burger. Ok, so typically I don't order anything teriyaki or anything ""Asian inspired"" because it usually tastes sweet. This burger is on the sweet side, but I still ate it anyway. Fries were ok, value was ok, service was alright and the decor is cute with the walls of cute cow cartoons. I would say it's not really worth the wait if you had to wait.   I got a chance to try my friends' other burgers and they tasted better. So while the Rising Sun burger is popular, I think I like the taste of the Nom Nom Burger (can't believe I could actually feel the crunch of potato chips in that one without it being messy) or the Fun-ghi burger - who can say no to melted cheese, mushrooms and onions?",-1,0
"Holsteins is a good option if you're in/near the Cosmopolitan and looking for a more casual place to sit down and eat.  They have a pretty large menu with a number of different burgers, sandwiches, alcoholic milkshakes, and other fun versions of bar food.    The food here was expensive for what it was (not a surprise, it's Vegas) and it was good, but I have definitely had a better burger.  I tried the new England Turkey Burger and the toppings were great (frisee, cranberry mayo, and stuffing), but the burger itself was weird... almost more like sausage than ground turkey?  The sweet potato fries were really good and I loved the truffle popcorn that they leave on the tables to snack on before your meal.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry to catch a show-- the service is sloooow even when the place isn't that busy.",-1,0
"Holsteins or Gordon Ramsay BurGR. Although close, I still vote for BurGR simply because Holsteins is a good $5 more expensive per burger with comparable quality in my opinion. My friend begs to differ but this is my review.  Drinks here are overpriced and very average, so I wouldn't recommend spending your money on them.  Burgers range from like $18-20 on average, and it's a very average sized patty, maybe 1/3lb. They are cooked well though, as you would expect.   As everyone says, I tried the Gold Standard burger with an egg and I finished that in like 2 minutes.  One thing for this place is that the place is pretty big and the we didn't have to wait very long, compared to a 30-45min wait at BurGR. Either way, I'd suggest coming here to try it if you haven't, since it's a decent place. As for me, I'd come back here only if I'm destroying the tables at Cosmo or literally have no time to eat elsewhere, otherwise I'd probably go to the Cosmo Buffet instead.",-1,0
